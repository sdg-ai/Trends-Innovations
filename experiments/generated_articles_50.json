      "text": "Revitalizing Urban Sustainability with Bicycles\n\nThe state of urban living in America is riddled with issues such as obesity, traffic congestion, social isolation, and diminished quality family time. We find ourselves questioning how we arrived at this point and what measures can be taken for a change. Having spent three months in Europe last summer, I can attest to the superior quality of life in comparison to American cities, which heavily rely on cars and lack vibrancy. The key to understanding our situation lies in the early abandonment of streetcars and bicycles in favor of automobiles without maintaining a balance. Historically, most American towns with populations exceeding 10,000 had well-established streetcar and bicycle networks until the 1930s. In modern times, European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen serve as role models for transportation balance and urban sustainability by leveraging the simple bicycle.\n\nEconomic Advantages and Health Benefits\n\nDenmark's establishment of tax-funded universal healthcare has incentivized investment in promoting bicycle usage due to the widely recognized health benefits. Research demonstrates a significant 30% reduction in mortality among adults who commute to work by bicycle. In Copenhagen alone, estimated annual savings of $100 million in healthcare costs have been reported, not accounting for the additional societal gains resulting from enhanced productivity driven by a healthier workforce. This doesn't even consider the cost savings related to reduced road maintenance and congestion. Construction of separated bikeways in Copenhagen costs about $2 million per mile on each side, and these expenses are fully recouped within five years. A comprehensive economic impact study projects that every mile cycled contributes a net gain of 21 cents to society, while driving a mile incurs a net loss of 12 cents. These figures encompass both public sector savings and increased private sector economic activity.\n\nBicycle Commuting and Sustainable Urban Solutions\n\nPresently, bike commuting rates in greater Copenhagen surpass the entire United States, with an average commute distance of approximately 3 \u00bd miles each way. Over the past three decades, Copenhagen has gradually reallocated car-parking and road space, paving the way for transformative bike infrastructure. Conversely, the Netherlands boasts a cycling culture more inclusive than any other country globally. An organization named the Dutch Cycling Embassy capitalizes on the esteemed Dutch model of urban transportation, offering insight to global business and government leaders concerned with urbanization, city revitalization, and sustainable transit solutions. The Dutch experience firsthand the multitude of benefits the bicycle provides in terms of improved health, livability, road safety, air quality, traffic flow, reduced social isolation, and a thriving economy.\n\nPromoting Bicycles as a Viable Mode of Transportation\n\nIn the United States, making bicycles a viable mode of transportation necessitates a shift in perception whereby cyclists are seen as regular citizens rather than members of a subculture. Copenhagenize, a Danish consulting firm, advises cities on behavior and marketing campaigns to promote positive imagery, urban mobility, and the development of \"complete streets\" \u2013 a concept championed by an American non-profit organization and movement bearing the same name. Significant progress has been made through these initiatives in various U.S. cities.\n\nEnhancing Urban Fabric and Fostering Downtown Vitality\n\nAs city leaders grapple with budget cuts, vacant sidewalks, and deliberations over accommodating growth, they seek sustainable development models. Look no further than the vibrant tourist destinations of Amsterdam and Copenhagen for inspiration. Similarly, many American cities possess sizeable areas for future growth; however, long-term vitality can only be achieved by centering development in existing built-up areas. Today's singles and young families yearn for enriched city life, complete with safe walking and biking paths through downtown centers teeming with shops, entertainment, and urban amenities. The Dutch and Danish urban models unequivocally demonstrate that significant numbers of people will regularly choose bicycles if extensive and appropriate infrastructure is integrated into our cities. The simple bicycle holds the key to unlocking smart growth in America without compromising our love affair with cars."

This comprehensive ranking evaluates over 115 cities worldwide biennially since 2011, focusing on factors such as ambition, culture, and streetscape design. In its fifth edition, the index provides valuable insights into the most bike-friendly cities globally.\n\nAt the forefront of the race are Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, who have consistently set the bar high for other cities to follow. Copenhagen, holding onto the top spot, showcases impressive statistics with 62 percent of inhabitants commuting by bike and collectively cycling 894,000 miles daily. This Danish city invests over $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure and continues to build new regional cycle highways and bridges.\n\nAmsterdam, after slipping to third place previously, has made an impressive comeback. With an increasing population of 11,000 residents every year, the Dutch capital has developed ambitious plans for 2022, emphasizing improvements in bicycle parking and existing infrastructure. Additional measures include widening cycle tracks, creating low-speed cycle streets, and redesigning major intersections to prioritize the safety and comfort of cyclists during rush hour.\n\nWhile the efforts of Copenhagen and Amsterdam are laudable, they are not alone in their dedication to fostering bike-friendly environments. Other cities like Antwerp, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, and Oslo have demonstrated remarkable progress in recent years. Moreover, cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are emerging as inspiring examples, showing the feasibility of transforming urban centers to be more conducive for biking.\n\nOutside the top 20, numerous cities are on the brink of breaking through. However, sustained investment and implementation of innovative biking infrastructure are crucial for these cities to improve their rankings in future editions of the index.\n\nAlthough these 20 cities have achieved distinction as the most bicycle-friendly destinations worldwide, challenges persist. In Copenhagen, for instance, political decisions and budget constraints imposed by the national government threaten the expansion of cycling infrastructure. The absence of strong political leadership dedicated to sustainable mobility poses obstacles for Copenhagen's future reputation as a global inspiration.\n\nSimilarly, while Amsterdam bounces back with renewed determination and visionary plans, the city must now focus on translating these proposals into action. Investments in additional biking connections, wider facilities, improved wayfinding systems, and stricter enforcement against mopeds infringing on cycle tracks will be crucial if Amsterdam aims to surpass Copenhagen and regain the top spot in 2021.\n\nBiking continues to prove its worth as the favored mode of urban transportation. As cities strive to integrate cycling into their mobility plans, developments in infrastructure, policies, and leadership play pivotal roles in creating genuinely bike-friendly environments. Ultimately, the goal is clear: to leverage the efficiency and sustainability benefits of biking while enhancing the overall quality of urban life."

      "text": "Why are bicycles crucial for creating vibrant and sustainable cities?\n\nCycling plays a vital role in the development of sustainable cities, making it an essential component of urban planning. Velo-city 2018, a conference dedicated to this topic, is set to explore various aspects of urban development, infrastructure, and alleviating traffic congestion. Ahead of the conference, let's delve into what constitutes a sustainable city from a cycling perspective.\n\nWith the projected influx of one billion new inhabitants by 2030, cities worldwide face significant challenges. Urban centers can no longer sustain continuous expansion while maintaining a high quality of life. The commuting time in cities should not exceed one hour, making it clear that alternative modes of transportation must be embraced. Relying on millions of additional cars would exacerbate the already alarming levels of pollution found in many cities, with air pollution causing mortality rates several times higher than road accidents. To confront these issues, urban development models need reevaluation, with a focus on bolstering public transport networks and promoting active mobility.\n\nA key principle underlying sustainable urban planning is the concept that roads are not exclusively for cars. The notion put forth by former New York Mayor M. Bloomberg in 2012 emphasized the importance of prioritizing cyclists and pedestrians over motorists. This idea resonates strongly with the United Nations' New World Urban Agenda, which champions cycling and walking as superior options to motorized vehicles. Consequently, investment in cycling and walking infrastructure is paramount. One notable example of successful implementation is the city of Seville, hailed as a \"poster city for sustainable transport\" in an article by The Guardian. In just a few years, the number of bicycle trips there multiplied by eleven\u2014an encouraging testament to the effectiveness of building connected and safe lanes.\n\nBuenos Aires also presents an unconventional case study in the emerging trend of cities investing significantly in cycling infrastructure. This Argentine capital has embarked on an ambitious project to improve its attractiveness and reduce traffic through an efficient public transport system supplemented by more than 140 kilometers of new cycle paths. As a result, Buenos Aires has earned a spot among the top 20 most bike-friendly cities, showcasing its commitment to building a livable city where bicycles serve as a primary mode of transportation.\n\nDespite these success stories, it remains evident that car-centric infrastructures often receive unwarranted government subsidies, deprioritizing initiatives such as cycle paths or pedestrianized zones. An example highlighting this issue is San Francisco, where a 2010 study revealed a staggering 441,541 parking spaces, over half of which were free on-street spots. Shifting the focus away from excessive parking to alternative means of transport not only reclaims valuable urban space but also encourages individuals to explore available options, reducing gas emissions. Positive developments are being seen globally, with many cities implementing new parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, recently abolished minimum car parking requirements and implemented a cap on the number of parking spots within specific projects.\n\nAdditionally, cities that prioritize pedestrian and cycling accessibility demonstrate higher GDP per capita\u2014a striking 38% increase compared to traffic-dominated counterparts. Research conducted by New Zealand University further supports this notion, revealing that every dollar invested in creating separated bike lanes could save as much as $24 due to reduced healthcare costs, decreased pollution, and improved traffic flow. However, it's important to note that investments in cycling infrastructure are often insufficient in scale and limited in their ability to effectively influence people's habits and perception of safety.\n\nIn the next article, we will delve into the topic of cycling in megacities, exploring further examples of urban sustainability from South America and Europe.\n\n(Source links:\n[1] https://nypost.com/2012/10/26/bloomberg-says-mass-transit-cyclists-more-important-than-drivers-who-clog-roads/\n[2] http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/commentary/2016/10/cycling-can-help-new-urban-agendas-aims-more-youd-think\n[3] Paragraph 114, UN World Urban Agenda - \"a significant increase in accessible safe, efficient, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure for public transport as well as non-motorized options such as walking and cycling, prioritizing them over private motorized transportation\"\n[4] Copenhagenizeindex, 2015 - http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/#\n[5] Article (only in Spanish) - http://www.ciclosfera.com/copenhagenize-buenos-aires-la-mejor-ciudad-de-latinoamerica-para-ir-en-bici/\n[6] (Only in Italian) - http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-07-20/ridisegnare-citta-misura-d-uomo-081253.shtml?refresh_ce=1)"

Today, bike-sharing programs have become a common sight with their brightly colored bikes dotting city streets.\n\nCargo bikes have garnered significant popularity among families, boasting strong electric motors that enable them to carry heavy loads. This versatility has also piqued interest among municipal and commercial users. Consequently, EUROBIKE, held in Friedrichshafen from 8-10 July 2018, will feature a dedicated Cargo category for the first time this year.\n\nIn recognition of cycling's societal benefits for transportation and leisure, the United Nations designated June 3rd as World Bicycle Day. The initiative aims to raise awareness about the positive impact of cycling, such as promoting sustainability, facilitating school attendance, and empowering individuals, especially girls, in rural areas of Africa. Notably, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has deployed 4,500 bicycles in Zambia to enhance agricultural production.\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), a global organization with offices in various countries, focuses on designing and implementing high-quality transport systems and policy solutions to create livable, equitable, and sustainable cities. ITDP has successfully proposed plans for bike lanes and parking networks, collaborating with local authorities to realize these projects. Recent achievements include supporting the launch of new bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\n\nUrban planners and architects adopt innovative concepts to make cycling more attractive and ensure perceived traffic safety. They strive to develop a forgiving infrastructure that motivates cyclists and encourages non-cyclists to embrace biking as a mode of transportation. London's \"Cycle Superhighways\" exemplify this vision, providing safe, direct, and efficient routes into the city and significantly reducing car traffic. Former London mayor Boris Johnson stated, \"Getting more people on their bikes will reduce pressure on the road, bus, and rail networks, cut pollution, and improve life for everyone.\"\n\nMelbourne's Bicycle Plan 2016-2020, titled \"A Connected City,\" prioritizes safe cycling within urban planning. The plan aims to facilitate convenient access to services and opportunities while creating a cleaner and less congested metropolis. In China, the city of Xiamen boasts the world's longest bicycle skyway, spanning 7.6 kilometers. This impressive infrastructure links major residential and business districts, enhancing connectivity and easing traffic congestion. Danish architecture studio DISSING + WEITLING, known for its renowned projects such as Copenhagen's Cycle Superhighways and the Bicycle Snake, served as the creative force behind Xiamen's cycle path design.\n\nInnovative bike manufacturers cater to the urban cycling trend by offering unique products across various categories, including e-bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and belt-drive bikes. Brian Hohl, industrial designer and inventor at DIAVELO - Protanium B.V (Accell Group), emphasizes the importance of integrating light, compact lithium batteries into electric bicycles. Protanium actively invests in projects promoting greener and healthier lifestyles, such as the EBIKE4DELIVERY initiative, which aims to create environmentally friendly jobs while delivering meals across Europe. Similarly, the use of cargo bikes for package delivery is gaining popularity worldwide, replacing traditional vehicles and reducing road congestion.\n\nChina and Taiwan dominate the global bicycle market, responsible for approximately 90% of the world's bicycle production. With rapidly increasing urbanization and the rise of car-centric culture, Chinese cities face immense challenges. However, many are embracing bike-sharing programs to reverse the dominance of cars. Competing with established providers from Europe and North America, Asian companies like Mobike, Ofo, and Yobike are making significant strides in expanding their rental bike systems globally. Challenges related to over-saturation and improper parking need to be addressed as bike-sharing continues to grow. Nonetheless, the data collected from these platforms opens up exciting possibilities for smart cities, where bikes, e-bikes, e-scooters, and semi-automated shuttle buses converge to enhance individual mobility.\n\nAs we witness the swift transformation of urban spaces into bike-friendly environments, it becomes evident that cycling contributes to a sustainable future. By prioritizing cycling infrastructure, investing in innovative bike technologies, and encouraging active transportation policies, cities can reap the benefits of reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life for all residents.\n\nLegal Notice"

      "text": "A Metrics for Assessing the Bike-Friendliness of American Cities\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, I am constantly amazed by the efficiency and convenience of biking compared to other modes of transportation within the borough. Unlike the subway system, which predominantly caters to routes leading to Manhattan, biking offers a more effective way to navigate around. Whether we are avid cyclists ourselves, have friends who bike, or simply get annoyed by bicyclists, it is crucial to consider how cities plan for and accommodate bicyclists.\n\nIndividually, we can make choices about our preferred mode of transportation. However, these choices are significantly influenced by the overall transportation infrastructure, which determines the accessibility and convenience of different routes, bike lanes, and pathways. These decisions have far-reaching consequences, considering that transportation accounts for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Additionally, transportation plays a vital role in public health as it affects pollution exposure levels and promotes active lifestyles. The World Health Organization reports that physical inactivity, overweightness, and obesity contribute to 11 percent of annual deaths worldwide.\n\nTo examine the state of bicycle commuting in the largest 35 cities across the United States, extensive research was conducted to understand what cities are doing to facilitate and encourage cycling, as well as identify areas for improvement. To facilitate this investigation, I participated in a sustainability indicators class led by Alex de Sherbinin, an esteemed environmental data analyst and associate director for science applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University. The course focused on sustainability indicators, which are valuable tools for measuring the sustainability of various societal, economic, and environmental systems. By amalgamating multiple individual indicators, we can create aggregate indexes that help educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and curious individuals interpret complex data more easily. Promoting experience-sharing among decision-makers becomes vital in improving urban infrastructure and fostering environmentally and socially resilient cities.\n\nMotivated by the aim to establish an index that recognizes the interconnectedness between socioeconomic aspects and the environment, my research highlights the importance of including environmental health factors in existing rankings of bike-friendly cities. Typically, air pollution may not be a primary consideration in discussions on enhancing bicycle infrastructure. Nevertheless, incorporating public health indicators into the evaluation process allows for a more comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to sustainability. This form of 'systems thinking' not only aids in addressing issues related to environmental health and vulnerability but also facilitates the development of resilient communities.\n\nMy index encompasses key dimensions such as social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To achieve a holistic perspective, I considered indicators such as the presence of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of full-time employees dedicated to bicycle-related initiatives within each city, and average exposure levels to three of the most harmful air pollutants. Additionally, I evaluated city infrastructure and safety based on metrics like the length of bike lanes, routes, and pathways relative to city size, the availability of shared bicycles per capita, and the incidence of bicyclist fatalities. It's important to note that sustainability indexes do not account for factors beyond a city's control, such as natural topography or extreme weather conditions.\n\nI collected pertinent data from reputable sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists. Additionally, input from both academic and non-academic experts was gathered to identify the most relevant and significant indicators. After conducting rigorous statistical analyses and normalizing the data, all indicators were combined into a single index using appropriate weighting techniques.\n\nThe resulting index provides insights into the bike-friendliness rankings of America's largest cities, considering a wide range of factors. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver emerged as top performers in terms of bicycle friendliness, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City ranked lowest.\n\nFurthermore, the index reveals patterns and correlations among different indicators. Notably, there is a negative correlation between the rate of individuals biking to work and the rate of bicyclist fatalities. In other words, cities with higher rates of commuting by bike tend to have lower rates of cyclist deaths, and vice versa. This finding presents a compelling argument for policymakers to prioritize and invest in the necessary infrastructure to encourage more people to commute by bicycle.\n\nAs climate change continues to shape our world, it is essential to adopt fresh perspectives regarding our environment. Sustainability indicators offer us an opportunity to reevaluate our relationship with both the built and natural environment, allowing us to envision a more resilient future. How we envision the future influences our actions and ultimately shapes the trajectory of climate change. By employing sustainability indices to improve access to alternative transportation methods, cities can actively promote cycling and contribute to changing the cycles of our climate.\n\nThis article was republished with permission from Earth Institute, Columbia University."

      "text": "Title: Biking for Sustainable Transport: A Pathway to Combat Climate Change\n\nArticle:\nTips & Resources for a Greener Future\n\nCan cycling make a difference in our fight against global warming? Absolutely! When more people embrace biking as a sustainable mode of transport, we can make a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe Role of Transportation in Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nTransportation contributes to almost 25% of global carbon emissions, predominantly because around 80% of urban dwellers choose high-emission motor vehicles for their daily commutes. However, it's worth noting that most trips are shorter than 10km, an ideal distance for cycling or as a means to connect with public transportation hubs. Providing secure bike parking facilities, such as the innovative Parkiteer system, can further encourage this shift.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of California, Davis, if bicycles and electric bikes accounted for 22% of all transport trips in cities worldwide, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption would decrease by a staggering 47% before 2050. This highlights the potential of biking as an eco-friendly solution.\n\nSpace Efficiency and Environmental Benefits\n\nIn addition to its environmental benefits, cycling is also space-efficient. By promoting biking infrastructure, we can create more space for trees, green areas, and reduce the need for heat-creating impermeable surfaces that displace water. This harmonious balance between sustainable transportation and nature preservation is crucial for creating healthier and greener cities.\n\nSustainable Commuting: Reducing Your Ecological Footprint\n\nEmbracing cycling as your primary mode of transportation can significantly reduce your ecological footprint. A report by the Queensland Government states that commuting to work by bike, covering a distance of 10km each way, can save 1,500kg of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Additionally, by choosing to cycle, you contribute to alleviating motor vehicle congestion across Australia's major cities, reducing 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.\n\nTo support individuals in making biking a part of their daily commute, various initiatives like the Ride2Work program have been established. The Ride2Work website provides valuable resources and knowledge to help you get started with bike commuting while also empowering others to do the same.\n\nBiking Beyond Work: Embracing Local Trips and Communities\n\nFor short trips to schools, stores, swimming pools, or gyms, biking is an excellent choice. Equip yourself with a basket or panniers to carry your belongings, and let the bike take the load.\n\nTo promote biking for school commutes, the Ride2School program offers comprehensive information and resources. Through this initiative, families and schools can foster a cycling culture, encouraging students to adopt sustainable transportation options early on.\n\nThe Joy of Sustainable Cycling: A Cyclist's Secret to Happiness\n\nChoosing sustainable transportation brings a sense of fulfillment and joy that only cyclists truly understand. Not only will you enjoy the health benefits of biking, but also the positive impact you're making on the environment.\n\nBuilding Sustainable Cities: Political Support and Advocacy\n\nGovernments play a vital role in establishing networks of bike lanes and paths to encourage more people to cycle. Local governments have already taken impressive steps towards sustainable transport solutions.\n\nInternationally recognized coalitions like the Compact of Mayors include Australian metropolitan mayors like Clover Moore of Sydney and Robert Doyle of Melbourne. These coalitions aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for climate action.\n\nCities like Melbourne have well-defined plans, including Bicycle and Walking Plans, to ensure diverse access to the Central Business District (CBD). They have even developed innovative Freight Plans, such as utilizing bicycle couriers instead of motor vehicle deliveries, emphasizing their commitment to sustainability.\n\nAt a national level, both the Turnbull Coalition Government and the opposition's Shadow Ministry for Cities, Infrastructure, and Transport have demonstrated bipartisan political support for livable cities. Urgent leadership is needed to prioritize walking, cycling, and public transport, as emphasized by Greens Senator Janet Rice in her interview with Bicycle Network.\n\nA Call to Action: Establishing a National Bicycle Infrastructure Fund\n\nTo unlock substantial health, economic, and livability benefits associated with bike-friendly cities, Bicycle Network urges the federal government to establish Australia's first national bicycle infrastructure fund. This dedicated fund would pave the way for greater biking accessibility and encourage more individuals to choose sustainable transportation options.\n\nBy embracing biking as a mode of transport, we can pave the path towards a greener future, combat climate change, and create more livable cities. Let's pedal together towards a more sustainable tomorrow."

      "text": "Why Biking is Key to Creating Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nBicycles have long been heralded as an energy-efficient mode of transportation that could revolutionize the development of sustainable cities. But what exactly are the benefits of cycling, and how do they contribute to urban environments? Moreover, what about the environmental impact and advantages of the infrastructure required for a thriving cycling culture in cities? In this article, we will delve into three primary benefits of biking and the establishment of bicycle networks, highlighting their positive role in creating environmentally sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nWhen compared to other transportation options, the energy required to manufacture a bicycle is minuscule. Data from 2008 in the United States revealed that producing a road bicycle with a carbon frame, weighing 7.2kg, consumed 11,546,658,000 joules of energy during the production process. On the contrary, producing a \"generic car\" demanded a whopping 118,284,466,000 joules of energy (Figures via WattzOn). Although variations exist based on bicycle type and external factors, it is evident that bikes possess significantly lower embodied energy than automobiles.\n\nFurthermore, the construction of bicycle lanes consumes less energy compared to constructing roads for cars. It requires less space, reduced foundations, materials, and entails lower maintenance costs\u2014all contributing to its energy efficiency.\n\nAir Quality Improvement\nThe environmental sustainability of bicycles extends beyond their lower energy requirements. Each individual who switches from a private, polluting mode of transportation to a bike\u2014since it produces zero emissions during use\u2014leads to reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality in cities. As more people embrace cycling, these benefits become increasingly tangible for everyone residing in urban areas.\n\nBy switching from driving cars to biking, individuals effectively decrease their personal carbon footprint and contribute to lower carbon emissions overall. When cycling becomes a genuine and attractive alternative to other modes of transport\u2014as it already is in some progressive cities\u2014achieving this modal shift becomes more attainable. An enhanced bicycle network plays a crucial part in this transformation, and when combined with a city's other cycling-related needs, it has the potential to bring about improved air quality.\n\nMitigating Noise Pollution\nPollution encompasses more than just emissions\u2014it also includes noise levels within cities. Excessive noise can be considered a pollutant due to its associated long-term health risks. Alok Jha states, \"Noise can increase the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the body, even during sleep. The longer these hormones circulate in the bloodstream, the greater the likelihood of life-threatening physiological problems.\"\n\nCertain cities are now prioritizing the reduction of noise pollution in their sustainability agendas. For example, Vancouver's 2020 action plan, designed to make the city \"the world's greenest,\" envisions a highly sustainable future characterized by \"less pollution and cleaner air, less machine noise, and more birdsong.\" While at times resembling a fairytale portrayal of sustainability, the inclusion of noise pollution reduction in these plans demonstrates that the issue is being taken seriously by certain cities.\n\nSimultaneously, reports highlight an increase in cycling levels as pivotal for community development, hinting at the role bicycles play in decreasing noise pollution.\n\nWhile bicycle networks and bicycles themselves cannot be the sole solution\u2014they cannot magically solve all urban challenges\u2014their positive impact should not be underestimated. Analyzing urban air quality is a complex task affected by numerous factors, such as weather, geography, and industrial activities. These are variables that bicycle networks have no control over and which vary from one city to another.\n\nNevertheless, cities that prioritize bicycles over other automated forms of transportation consume less energy, emit fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise. Embracing cycling as a key component of urban life paves the way for greener, healthier, and more environmentally sustainable cities worldwide.\n\nPhoto: lopify.

      "text": "Sustainable Urban Living: Embracing the Bicycle Revolution\n\nCities across America are facing a multitude of challenges, from soaring obesity rates and traffic congestion to diminishing quality family time and socially isolated city centers. It's essential that we reflect on how we arrived at this point and consider the necessary changes. Having lived in Europe last summer, I can personally attest to the stark contrast between their vibrant, livable cities and our car-dependent, soulless urban landscapes. The loss of streetcars and bicycles as key modes of transportation in American cities during the 1930s largely contributed to this transformation. However, some European cities, such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, have become inspiring examples of restoring transportation balance and sustainability through the humble bicycle.\n\nThe Economic Impact of Bicycles and Health Benefits\n\nIn Denmark, where universal health care is funded by taxpayers, there has been a significant push to promote and invest in bicycle usage due to the well-known and accepted health benefits it offers. Research shows that adults who commute to work by bicycle experience a 30% reduction in mortality. The city of Copenhagen estimates annual savings of $100 million in healthcare costs alone, not to mention the additional gains from increased productivity resulting from a healthier workforce. Moreover, reduced road maintenance and congestion translate into further savings. In Copenhagen, the cost of building separated bike lanes amounts to around $2 million per mile per side, which is recouped within five years. An economic impact study conducted in the city demonstrates that every mile cycled yields a net societal gain of 21 cents, compared to a net loss of 12 cents per mile driven by cars. These figures consider both public sector savings and the subsequent increase in private sector economic activity.\n\nBicycle Commuting for Urban Sustainability\n\nIt's astonishing to note that more people now bike to work in greater Copenhagen than in the entire United States. The average commuting distance for Copenhageners by bicycle is approximately 3 \u00bd miles each way. Over the past three decades, the city has gradually reclaimed car-parking spaces and road areas to make way for dedicated cycling infrastructure.\n\nThe Netherlands, widely regarded as a global cycling haven, boasts an organization called the Dutch Cycling Embassy, which capitalizes on their acclaimed urban transportation model. This public-private initiative promotes urban mobility, demonstrating the value of cycling to business and government leaders worldwide who seek to revitalize cities while ensuring transit sustainability. The Dutch possess firsthand experience regarding the direct contribution of bicycles to improved health, urban livability, road safety, cleaner air, smoother traffic flow, decreased social isolation, and a healthier economy.\n\nMarketing the Bicycle as an Essential Transit Mode\n\nIn the United States, transforming bicycles into a viable form of transit requires a shift in perceptions. It means repositioning bicycle users as regular citizens rather than marginalized members of a subculture known as \"cyclists.\" Danish consulting firm, Copenhagenize, advises cities worldwide on inducing positive associations with bikes and urban mobility through marketing campaigns and behavior alignment. Their name encapsulates the goal of creating \"complete streets,\" a concept championed by American nonprofit organization and movement, responsible for several improvements in US cities.\n\nEnhancing the Urban Landscape and Restoring Downtown Vitality\n\nAs declining state and federal funding, vacant sidewalks, and decisions concerning future growth weigh upon our cities, urban leaders look for sustainable development models. Valuable solutions can be found in the popular tourist destinations of Amsterdam and Copenhagen. These cities, like many in the US, face limitations in available land for expansion. While countless American cities boast vast undeveloped areas, long-term vitality necessitates focusing growth within existing built-up zones. Today, young adults and families yearn for vibrant town lives, allowing them to safely walk or bike amidst a downtown brimming with shops, entertainment, and urban amenities. Dutch and Danish urban models have proven that substantial numbers of people would choose bicycles as their primary mode of transportation if comprehensive cycling infrastructure was integrated into our cities. The simple bicycle holds the potential to unlock smart growth opportunities in America without undermining our love affair with cars."

In its fifth biennial edition since 2011, the Index evaluates and ranks over 115 cities using 14 parameters that focus on ambition, culture, and streetscape design. (Read more about our methodology here.)\n\nAt the forefront of this competition, the top three contenders remain as fiercely contested as ever. While Copenhagen retains its leading position, Amsterdam has overtaken Utrecht to claim second place with recent bold interventions championing biking. These three cities continue to serve as role models for others, inspiring friendly rivalry. However, it's not just the Danish and Dutch cities taking bicycling seriously - the competition is intensifying between Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux, forming the secondary pack. Notably, Oslo has soared through the ranks in the past four years, and cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are exemplary newcomers that showcase the potential for enhancing urban centers to become more bicycle-friendly. Just outside the top 20 lies a group of cities poised to break through, each requiring sustained investments and the implementation of innovative biking strategies to achieve higher rankings in 2021.\n\nFor now, let's dive into the current list of the world's 20 most bike-friendly cities.\n\nDeep Dive: The statistics speak for themselves; an astounding 62 percent of residents' commutes to work or school are made by bike. Copenhageners collectively cycle 894,000 miles each day. Furthermore, the city invests more than $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure initiatives. With four new bicycle bridges either built or under construction and 104 miles of regional cycle highways, Copenhagen sets an impressive standard. As witnessed in the 2018 municipal elections, political parties advocating for cars faced little success. However, amidst these achievements, it's crucial to address challenges. Imposed spending limits by the national government have affected infrastructure expansion, threatening Copenhagen's cycling reputation. Moreover, the absence of strong political leadership focusing on sustainable mobility is diminishing the prioritization of cycling investment, placing it lower than car parking. To maintain its global inspiration status in the years ahead, the city must navigate these obstacles effectively.\n\nDeep Dive: After slipping to third place previously, Amsterdam is making a resounding comeback in 2019. The Dutch capital showcases how a city can recognize areas for improvement and regain its standing. Since the last index, Amsterdam has announced an ambitious plan for 2022, emphasizing better bicycle parking facilities and upgrading existing infrastructure. With a surge of 11,000 new inhabitants annually, the city is developing new \"royal routes\" to accommodate the increasing number of cyclists. To alleviate rush hour congestion, the city is widening existing cycle tracks to over eight feet, constructing more low-speed cycle streets, and redesigning major intersections to create safer spaces for cyclists.\n\nHowever, realizing these plans necessitates effective implementation. By enhancing cycling connections, expanding facilities, improving wayfinding systems, and enforcing stricter regulations on mopeds within cycle tracks, Amsterdam aims to reclaim the top spot from Copenhagen in 2021 and assert its dominance once more.\n\nAs our urban landscapes evolve, the need for sustainable and healthy modes of transportation becomes increasingly critical. Biking, with its time-honored simplicity, continues to thrive and shape our cities positively. These 20 bike-friendly cities set an inspiring example for the rest of the world, highlighting the countless benefits that arise when communities prioritize cycling as a viable and preferred mode of transport."

      "text": "Why are bicycles crucial for creating livable and sustainable cities?\n\nCycling plays a vital role in the planning of sustainable cities. Velo-city 2018, a prominent conference dedicated to biking, will delve into this topic extensively. The conference program features various sessions that address urban planning, infrastructure, and other relevant issues like traffic congestion. As we eagerly anticipate discussions at the upcoming event in Rio from June 12 to 15, let's briefly examine what it means to plan a sustainable city from a cycling perspective.\n\nAs we approach 2030, cities worldwide will witness an influx of one billion new inhabitants seeking employment opportunities, more prosperity, and a vibrant social life. However, cities cannot continue expanding indefinitely at the current rate. Commuting time needs to be limited to one hour, and allowing millions of new cars to enter our already polluted urban centers is simply not feasible. In fact, air pollution is accountable for a mortality rate five to ten times higher than road accidents. Consequently, we must reevaluate our existing urban development models and prioritize public transportation and active forms of mobility.\n\nIt is imperative to recognize that roads are not solely intended for cars. As former New York City mayor M. Bloomberg stated in 2012, cyclists and pedestrians hold more significance than motorists. This sentiment echoes throughout the UN's New World Urban Agenda, which explicitly places cycling and walking above motorized vehicles as top priorities. Achieving this goal necessitates substantial investment in cycling and walking infrastructure.\n\nThe city of Seville serves as a compelling example in this regard. Highlighted in an insightful article by The Guardian, the capital of Andalusia stands as a \"poster city for sustainable transport.\" Within a few years, the number of bike trips multiplied eleven-fold, showcasing the positive impact of sufficient, interconnected, and safe cycling lanes. This success story goes beyond traditional examples like the Netherlands or Denmark, proving that \"almost any urban area can encourage a large number of people to ride bikes by simply constructing enough connected and safe lanes.\"\n\nAnother unconventional yet noteworthy example is Buenos Aires, which has made significant investments in cycling infrastructure in recent years and secured a spot among the top 20 most bike-friendly cities. Over 140 kilometers of new cycle paths have been developed with the aim of enhancing the city's appeal, reducing traffic congestion, and fostering an efficient public transportation system. Ultimately, the objective is to create a more livable city and establish bicycles as a common mode of transportation.\n\nHowever, despite these success stories, car-centric urban infrastructures continue to receive significant subsidies. Local policies often prioritize parking spaces over cycle paths or pedestrianized zones. For instance, a study conducted in 2010 revealed that San Francisco alone boasted 441,541 parking spaces, with more than half being offered free of charge. By curtailing costly parking spaces, urban areas not only reclaim valuable space but also incentivize people to adopt alternative modes of transportation, resulting in reduced emissions. While much work still lies ahead, tangible progress has been made worldwide, with many cities implementing new parking policies. For example, S\u00e3o Paulo's legislation abolished minimum car parking requirements and set limits on the number of parking spots allowed in specific projects.\n\nFurthermore, cities with high levels of pedestrian and cycling accessibility exhibit per capita GDP levels that are 38% higher compared to cities dominated by traffic. Researchers from New Zealand University have revealed that every dollar spent on constructing new separated bike lanes could yield savings of up to $24 by reducing healthcare costs, pollution, and traffic-related issues. Nonetheless, investments in cycling infrastructure often remain inadequate, limiting their capacity to create a substantial, positive impact on people's habits and their sense of safety.\n\nIn the next article, we will explore cycling in megacities and revisit the subject of urban sustainability, featuring case studies from South America and Europe.\n\n[1] Source: https://nypost.com/2012/10/26/bloomberg-says-mass-transit-cyclists-more-important-than-drivers-who-clog-roads/\n[2] Additional information: http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/commentary/2016/10/cycling-can-help-new-urban-agendas-aims-more-youd-think\n[3] Paragraph 114, UN World Urban Agenda emphasizes \"a significant increase in accessible, safe, efficient, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure for public transport as well as non-motorized options such as walking and cycling, prioritizing them over private motorized transportation\"\n[4] Data from Copenhagenizeindex, 2015 http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/#\n[5] Spanish article available at: http://www.ciclosfera.com/copenhagenize-buenos-aires-la-mejor-ciudad-de-latinoamerica-para-ir-en-bici/\n[6] Italian article available at: http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-07-20/ridisegnare-citta-misura-d-uomo-081253.shtml?refresh_ce=1"

      "text": "Urban Cycling: Enhancing Quality of Life with Sustainable Modes of Transportation\n\nInterested in joining an award-winning biking community? Sign up for one of our prestigious professional or student awards. Upgrade your biking experience by upgrading your browser.\n\nWhen it comes to urban planning, the equation \"social and sustainable city = bicycle-friendly city\" holds true. Cities such as London and Melbourne are directing significant investments towards building extensive bicycle networks that serve as efficient commuter and transport routes. This growing trend in urban cycling is not just driven by the need to alleviate traffic congestion but also by bike manufacturers who recognize the potential for change. Brightly colored bike-sharing programs have become a common sight on city streets, offering an accessible and eco-friendly mode of transportation.\n\nCargo bikes have gained popularity among families and, more recently, as practical solutions for municipal and commercial purposes. These bikes equipped with robust electric motors enable users to carry heavy loads, making them attractive options for various industries. EUROBIKE, a renowned exhibition held in Friedrichshafen, is introducing a Cargo category this year to acknowledge the significance of cargo bikes in urban environments.\n\nIn an effort to promote the benefits of cycling, the United Nations (UN) declared June 3 as World Bicycle Day. This official observance aims to raise awareness about the positive societal impacts of using bicycles for both transportation and leisure activities. Bicycles play a crucial role in promoting sustainability, supporting education (especially for girls in rural areas), and enhancing agricultural production in developing countries. Initiatives like the \"Come on Let's Bike\" campaign in Syria are aimed at reducing the gender gap in bicycling.\n\nOrganizations such as the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) work globally to design and implement high-quality transport systems. The ITDP has been successful in proposing plans for bike lanes and parking in many cities worldwide. They have collaborated with authorities to bring these plans to fruition, including the introduction of bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\n\nContemporary bicycle-oriented concepts prioritize user appeal and perceived traffic safety in urban planning. Planners strive to create a forgiving infrastructure and instill enthusiasm for cycling among the public. Encouraging existing cyclists to continue using bikes while motivating non-cyclists to give it a try is a shared goal.\n\nLondon has made significant strides in improving cycling infrastructure, particularly through its \"Cycle Superhighways.\" These carefully designed cycle routes provide safer, faster, and more direct journeys to and within the city. Former Mayor Boris Johnson recognized the benefits of increased cycling, stating that it reduces pressure on roads, public transportation, and air quality. His successor, Sadiq Khan, has pledged a substantial investment in cycling infrastructure. The separate cycle paths, known as the Superhighway network, have already resulted in a marked decline in car traffic.\n\nSimilarly, the city of Melbourne in Australia has developed its Bicycle Plan 2016-2020 titled \"A Connected City.\" This plan prioritizes safe cycling in urban areas to ensure easy access to services and reduce congestion in a cleaner and more livable city.\n\nNotable examples of remarkable architecture in support of cycling can be found in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The Hovenring bicycle bridge offers breathtaking views as cyclists ride in a circular path suspended 70 meters above the ground. Furthermore, the Van Gogh Path by Daan Roosegaarde illuminates patterns inspired by Vincent van Gogh's iconic painting \"The Starry Night.\" These innovative structures combine functionality with aesthetic appeal, enhancing the overall biking experience.\n\nBicycle manufacturers continue to contribute to the urban cycling trend by introducing unique products in various segments. From e-bikes and folding bikes to cargo bikes and belt-drive bikes, there is a wide range of options available for private, commercial, and municipal use. One example of innovation in the industry is DIAVELO's use of light, compact lithium batteries for electric bicycles. Their designs focus on integration, ensuring that the battery seamlessly blends with the bike while being easily removable for charging.\n\nDelivery services adopting heavy-duty cargo bikes as an environmentally friendly alternative to motorized vehicles is another emerging trend. Major parcel service providers in Germany, such as DHL and UPS, utilize cargo bikes to navigate urban areas with ease, minimizing road congestion and pollution.\n\nChina and Taiwan dominate the global bicycle market, accounting for around 90% of production. An increasing number of bike-sharing providers from Asia, such as Mobike, Ofo, and Obike, are expanding their reach to Europe and the United States. These companies face stricter regulations in North America due to concerns regarding bike clutter and overpopulation of rental bikes. However, the trend continues to grow, with bike-sharing transitioning into other last-mile solutions like e-scooters and semi-automated shuttle buses, promoting sustainable individual mobility in smart cities.\n\nWith urban populations on the rise, embracing urban cycling has become vital for fostering social well-being, environmental sustainability, and economic development. The pursuit of a bicycle-friendly city contributes to a better quality of life by reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and providing healthier and more enjoyable modes of transportation. So, hop on your bike and join the global urban cycling movement today!\n\n(Note: The original article contains a legal notice, which has been excluded in the rewritten version.)"

      "text": "A Metric of Sustainable Comparison for Assessing Bike-Friendliness in U.S. Metropolises\n\nIn the bustling borough of Brooklyn, I'm consistently astounded by the efficiency and agility afforded to those who travel on two wheels. The subway system primarily connects to Manhattan, causing intra-borough commuting within other areas of the city to be less than ideal. And that's where biking comes into play, offering a faster and more effective means of transportation compared to subways. Whether we personally opt for bicycles as our mode of transport, have acquaintances who do, or just experience occasional annoyance with cyclists, it's worth pondering how cities account for bicyclists\u2014or often, how they don't.\n\nIndividually, we make choices about how we navigate our surroundings. However, these choices are heavily influenced by the larger framework of transportation infrastructure, which determines the ease of access and convenience of roads, subway routes, and bike lanes. These decisions carry significant weight since transportation contributes to nearly a quarter of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Moreover, transportation plays a crucial role in public health, influencing pollution exposure and physical activity levels. In fact, inadequate exercise, obesity, and being overweight collectively account for 11 percent of annual global deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn my exploration of bicycle commuting across the 35 largest cities in the United States, I was particularly interested in examining their efforts to facilitate biking and identify areas where improvement is needed. Recently, I had the privilege of attending a sustainability indicators class taught by an exceptional environmental data analyst named Alex de Sherbinin. Serving as the associate director for science applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) based in Columbia, his course delved deep into measuring the sustainability of socio-economic and environmental systems using indicators. By compiling various indicators, we can formulate aggregate indexes that offer concise insights interpretable by educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and curious individuals worldwide. Furthermore, fostering knowledge sharing among decision makers becomes a vital tool in enhancing urban infrastructure and assisting cities in their quest to become more resilient, both environmentally and socially.\n\nMotivated by the desire to create an index that acknowledges the interconnectedness of socioeconomics and the environment, I realized that existing rankings evaluating the bike-friendliness of U.S. cities tend to overlook environmental health factors. It's true that addressing air pollution may not typically feature prominently when contemplating how to enhance bicycle infrastructure. Nevertheless, integrating public health indicators into assessments constitutes a critical step toward achieving multidisciplinary and meaningful sustainability. Engaging in this type of \"systems thinking\" proves valuable not only for comprehending environmental health challenges and vulnerabilities but also for cultivating community resilience.\n\nMy index takes into account social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To promote a holistic perspective, I incorporated indicators such as the presence of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of full-time employees dedicated to bicycle-related issues in a city, and average exposure levels to three highly hazardous air pollutants. Additionally, city infrastructure and safety were considered through variables like miles of bicycle infrastructure (including bike lanes, routes, and pathways) relative to city size, availability of bicycles through bike-sharing programs in relation to the total population, and rates of cyclist fatalities. Sustainability indexes exclude indicators outside the direct control of cities, such as hilly terrain or extreme temperatures.\n\nBuilding the index involved extracting data from three valuable sources: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists. Additionally, I actively sought input from experts within and beyond the academic realm to determine which indicators were regarded as the most important and relevant. Employing several statistical analyses and computations to address bias and standardize the data, the final step entailed aggregating all the indicators into a comprehensive index, combining normalized and weighted individual metrics.\n\nBy collating and analyzing the data, we gain insights into how the largest cities in the country rank in terms of bike-friendliness, considering a wide range of factors. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver emerged as top performers, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City found themselves lagging at the bottom of the ranks.\n\nFurthermore, the index reveals patterns within the data, exposing correlations between different indicators. For example, one striking implication drawn from the data is the negative correlation observed between the percentage of individuals biking to work and the rate of cyclist fatalities. Essentially, cities boasting higher rates of bicycle commuting experience lower fatality rates among cyclists, and vice versa. This finding can serve as powerful evidence for policymakers advocating the necessary infrastructure improvements required to encourage more individuals to adopt cycling as a primary mode of commuting.\n\nClimate change impacts not solely the environment but also our perspectives on it. Sustainability indicators, too, provide fresh lenses through which we can view our relationship with the built and natural world, enabling us to envision a more resilient future. How we imagine the future profoundly affects our actions, ultimately shaping the trajectory of climate change itself. Consequently, employing sustainability indices to enhance access to alternative transportation methods allows cities to foster cycling and contribute to altering the cycles of our climate.\n\nThis article is republished from the Earth Institute, Columbia University blog: http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu."

      "text": "Title:\nPromoting Sustainable Transportation Through Cycling\n\nArticle:\nExpert Tips & Valuable Resources for Environmentally-Friendly Biking\n\nCan cycling help combat global warming? Absolutely! By encouraging more individuals to opt for biking as a sustainable mode of transportation, we can make a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions.\nEnvironmental Impact of Transport\nTransportation is responsible for almost 25% of global carbon emissions, with around 80% of urban dwellers choosing high-emission motor vehicles for their private trips.\nInterestingly, most journeys are shorter than 10km, making them ideal distances for cycling or using electric bikes (ebikes). This could involve commuting directly to your destination or utilizing bikes to connect with public transportation hubs, while ensuring convenient and secure bike parking facilities like Parkiteer.\nAccording to the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of California, Davis, if bikes and ebikes accounted for 22% of all transport trips worldwide, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption would be significantly reduced by 47% before 2050.\nCycling's Efficiency & Environmental Benefits\nApart from its positive contribution to reducing carbon emissions, cycling also offers space efficiency. It requires less road space compared to motor vehicles, thereby allowing for more green spaces, trees, and less pavement covered in impermeable surfaces that generate heat and displace water.\nEmbrace Sustainable Commuting\nYou can start reducing your ecological footprint today by turning your carbon footprint into a bike-tyre print when it comes to transportation.\nA report by the Queensland Government reveals that biking to work, covering a distance of 10km each way, can save approximately 1,500kg of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Additionally, this switch would alleviate motor vehicle congestion, currently contributing 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gases across Australia's major cities.\nTo support individuals in making cycling their preferred mode of transportation to work or study, the Ride2Work program provides valuable resources and guidance. Their website equips you with essential know-how for commuting by bike and empowers you to encourage others to do the same.\nDon't limit biking to just work commutes - local trips to places like schools, shops, pools, and gyms are perfect for embracing cycling as well. Equip yourself with baskets or panniers to let the bike carry your load.\nTo facilitate cycling to school, the Ride2School program offers comprehensive information and resources for families and helps foster a cycling culture within educational institutions.\nThe Joy of Sustainable Transport & Action Required\nCyclists know the immense satisfaction that comes with adopting sustainable transportation practices. Embracing cycling not only contributes to a healthier environment but also promotes personal happiness and well-being.\nGovernments must prioritize the development of dedicated bike paths and lanes to encourage more people to cycle. Local governments, particularly, are taking initiative in envisioning and implementing sustainable transportation networks.\nFor instance, the global group Compact of Mayors includes Australian metropolitan mayors Clover Moore of Sydney and Robert Doyle of Melbourne, who have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advocating for climate action.\nIn Melbourne, the City Council has developed both a Walking Plan and a Bicycle Plan to enhance accessibility to the central business district (CBD). They have also introduced a Last Kilometre Freight Plan, aiming to replace motor vehicle deliveries with eco-friendly alternatives such as bicycle couriers.\nMoreover, national leadership in improving city livability now stands bipartisan. The Turnbull Coalition Government established the Ministry for Cities in 2015, matching the opposition's Shadow Ministry for Cities, Infrastructure, and Transport.\nJanet Rice, a Greens Senator, emphasizes the need for further leadership, stating that priority should be given to walking, cycling, and public transport. Bicycle Network, an advocacy organization, calls upon the federal government to establish Australia's first national bicycle infrastructure fund to unlock the immense health, economic, and livability benefits associated with bike-friendly cities."

      "text": "Why Cycling is Essential for Building Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nCycling has long been hailed as a catalyst for creating greener and more sustainable cities, but what are the exact benefits and how do they contribute to urban development? Moreover, how does the necessary infrastructure for cycling impact the environment and enhance the growth of biking culture in cities? This article delves into three key advantages of cycling and bicycle networks, emphasizing their positive role in fostering environmentally sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Requirements\nCompared to other modes of transportation, bicycles require minuscule amounts of energy to produce. In 2008, data from the United States revealed that a road bicycle with a carbon frame weighing 7.2kg consumed only 11,546,658,000 Joules of energy during production, while the figure for a 'generic car' was a staggering 118,284,466,000 Joules (Figures via WattzOn). Of course, variations exist depending on bicycle type and external factors. However, even considering these variables, bicycles have significantly lower embodied energy.\n\nMoreover, constructing bicycle lanes consumes less energy than building roads for automobiles. Bicycle lanes utilize smaller spaces, necessitate fewer foundations and materials, and incur lower maintenance costs, all contributing to reduced energy consumption.\n\nAir Quality Impact\nThe environmental sustainability of bicycles extends beyond just their low energy requirements. When individuals switch from private, polluting vehicles to bicycles\u2014a zero-emission form of transport\u2014their cities experience decreased carbon emissions and improved air quality. If a substantial number of people were to embrace cycling, these benefits would become tangible for urban dwellers.\n\nEach person who swaps driving a car for riding a bike leaves a smaller personal carbon footprint and generates fewer carbon emissions. If cycling becomes a viable and enticing alternative to other modes of transportation (as it already is in some cities), achieving significant modal shift becomes plausible. An enhanced bicycle network is a pivotal element in this transition, and when combined with other cycling initiatives in a city, it becomes feasible to achieve improved air quality.\n\nNoise Pollution\nPollution encompasses more than just harmful emissions\u2014it also includes noise levels in cities, which can be considered a pollutant due to associated long-term health risks. Noise can elevate stress hormone levels such as cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the body, even during sleep. Prolonged circulation of these hormones in the bloodstream increases the likelihood of life-threatening physiological issues (Alok Jha).\n\nSome cities are placing particular emphasis on reducing noise pollution in their sustainability agendas. For instance, Vancouver's 2020 action plan envisions a future where the city becomes \"the world's greenest,\" characterized by less pollution, cleaner air, diminished machine noise, and increased birdsong.\n\nAlthough this vision may sound somewhat utopian, the focus on reducing noise pollution demonstrates growing consideration for the issue in select cities. The same report also highlights the pivotal role of cycling in developing communities, subtly suggesting that bicycles can help curb noise pollution.\n\nDespite these evident urban benefits, it is important to note that bicycle networks and bicycles alone cannot solve all sustainability challenges\u2014it is far more complex than that! Urban air quality is influenced by various factors like weather, geography, and industries, elements outside the control of bicycle networks, varying from one city to another. Furthermore, cities will always consume energy, emit carbon, and create noise. However, a city that heavily relies on bicycles compared to other automated forms of transportation will inevitably consume less energy, emit fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise.\n\n[Photo by lopify]\n\nNote: This article is an updated version initially published in November 2011."

      "text": "Transforming Urban Sustainability Through Bicycles\n\nIn our quest to tackle pressing societal challenges like obesity, traffic congestion, and social isolation, Americans find themselves questioning the current state of affairs. By observing the thriving quality of life in European cities, particularly those like Amsterdam and Copenhagen that have embraced bicycles as a vital mode of transportation, we can find inspiration for change. Unfortunately, the United States surrendered its streets to cars without fostering a balance by maintaining streetcars and bicycles, which were once prevalent in American towns until the 1930s. However, the tide is turning, with many European cities leading the way in restoring transportation equilibrium and sustainability through the simple bicycle.\n\nThe Economic Impact and Health Benefits of Cycling\n\nDenmark's commitment to universal healthcare has led to substantial investment in promoting bicycle usage due to its well-established health benefits. Studies have shown that adults who commute to work by bike experience a remarkable 30% reduction in mortality. In fact, the city of Copenhagen estimates annual savings of $100 million in healthcare costs alone. These figures do not account for the increased productivity resulting from a healthier workforce, the savings from reduced road maintenance, or the economic activity generated. Constructing dedicated bikeways in Copenhagen costs approximately $2 million per mile on each side, an expense that is fully recouped within five years. The city's economic impact study concludes that for every mile cycled, society gains a net profit of 21 cents, while driving a car results in a net loss of 12 cents per mile. These calculations encompass both public sector savings and the buoyant private sector activity linked to biking.\n\nBicycle Commuting Fuels Urban Sustainability\n\nSurprisingly, more people bike to work in greater Copenhagen than across the entire United States, with commuters averaging a 3 \u00bd mile journey each way. Over the past three decades, Copenhagen has systematically removed car parking spaces and restructured road space, prioritizing bike infrastructure. Taking inspiration from Netherlands' cycling culture, a model praised worldwide, the Dutch Cycling Embassy, is a public-private organization that harnesses the power of urban mobility for sustainable development. As urbanization continues to reshape cities globally, it encourages business and government leaders to embrace the need for revitalization and transit solutions rooted in sustainability. The Dutch recognize firsthand the positive impact of bicycles on health, livability, road safety, air quality, traffic flow, social connectedness, and economic prosperity.\n\nPositioning the Bicycle as a Viable Transit Option\n\nIn the United States, making bicycles a feasible form of transportation involves shifting the perception of bicycle users as regular citizens rather than perpetuating the notion of them as sub-culture \"cyclists.\" Consulting firm Copenhagenize champions this cause by guiding cities on behavior and marketing campaigns that promote positive imagery of bikes and urban mobility. Their mission aligns with that of the American non-profit organization and movement, \"Complete Streets,\" which propels cities toward more livable environments.\n\nEnhancing Urban Fabric and Reviving Downtown Vitality\n\nFacing declining state and federal funding, vacant sidewalks, and questions surrounding future growth, city leaders seek models of sustainable development. They need not look further than Amsterdam and Copenhagen, renowned tourist destinations, where limited land mass necessitates development within existing built-up areas. Today's singles and young families desire vibrant town life that allows for safe walking and biking through downtowns teeming with shops, entertainment, and urban amenities. The success of Dutch and Danish urban models exemplifies how integrating extensive cycling infrastructure into our cities can unleash a wave of smart growth without sacrificing our attachment to cars."

      "text": "Title: Top 20 Bike-Friendly Cities in the World, Ranked\n\nArticle:\nIn a world where urban mobility is constantly evolving, one mode of transportation stands steady and strong: the bicycle. While flashy alternatives like autonomous cars and dockless pogosticks grab attention, the bicycle remains the most efficient, practical, and reliable solution for navigating cities. Recognizing this, many cities are investing in infrastructure and expanding facilities to promote cycling as an everyday mode of transport, ultimately enhancing the livability of urban environments.\n\nThere are certain cities that excel in fostering a pro-cycling culture and implementing initiatives to support biking. To keep track of their efforts, the Copenhagenize Index presents a comprehensive ranking of the world's most bike-friendly cities. Published biennially since 2011, this year's index evaluates and ranks over 115 cities worldwide based on 14 key parameters that consider ambition, cultural factors, and streetscape design (you can read about the methodology here).\n\nAt the top of the list, we witness a fierce three-way competition. While Copenhagen retains its position as the leading bike-friendly city, Amsterdam has overtaken Utrecht to claim the second spot with its recent significant strides. All three cities continue to serve as role models for the friendly competition below. Moreover, it's not just the Danish and Dutch cities that prioritize cycling; other cities are also taking the bicycle seriously. Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux form the closely trailing pack. Oslo, on the other hand, has made remarkable progress in the rankings over the past four years, while newcomers like Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are demonstrating how urban centers can be transformed into bike-friendly havens. Just outside the top 20 are several cities on the verge of breaking through, requiring continued investment and the implementation of innovative bike-centric initiatives to improve their rankings in future editions of the index.\n\nFor now, let's explore the current top 20 most bicycle-friendly cities in the world:\n\nCopenhagen: Attesting to its status as a global biking icon, 62 percent of Copenhageners choose bicycles for their daily commutes, covering a staggering 894,000 miles collectively each day. The city has been investing more than $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure and boasts the construction of four bicycle bridges along with 104 miles of new regional cycle highways. However, limitations imposed on municipal spending by the national government have raised concerns about the city's ability to maintain its cycling reputation. With political leadership focused on sustainable mobility noticeably absent since the last election, Copenhagen must prioritize cycling and find solutions to sustain its global influence.\n\nAmsterdam: After slipping to third place previously, Amsterdam has made an impressive comeback in 2019. This Dutch capital promptly recognized the need to reverse the trend, devising a robust plan that extends until 2022. The plan emphasizes improving bicycle parking facilities and upgrading existing cycling infrastructure. Given the influx of 11,000 new residents annually, Amsterdam is creating \"royal routes\" specifically designed to accommodate the growing number of cyclists. To alleviate rush hour stress, the city intends to widen cycle tracks to over eight feet, establish more low-speed cycle streets, and redesign major intersections to provide additional protected cycling space. The challenge now lies in transforming these plans into reality, ensuring that Amsterdam becomes the epitome of cycling in the 2020s. With enhanced bicycle connections, expanded facilities, clearer wayfinding, and stricter enforcement against mopeds infiltrating cycle tracks, Amsterdam could potentially surpass Copenhagen in the upcoming 2021 rankings and reclaim the throne.\n\nThese cities, along with the other top performers, encourage and inspire the rest of the world to embrace cycling as a significant mode of urban transportation. By prioritizing bicycles, investing in cycling infrastructure, and fostering a pro-cycling culture, they pave the way towards greener, healthier, and more vibrant cities. As urban environments evolve, these cities set the bar high and demonstrate the transformative power of embracing bikes as a primary means of mobility."

      "text": "Why are bikes crucial for creating livable and sustainable cities?\n\nBiking plays a vital role in the development of sustainable cities. As we eagerly await the Velo-city 2018 conference, which will delve into topics like urban planning, infrastructure, and overall urban growth, it's important to understand what planning a sustainable city means from a cycling perspective.\n\nWith the projected influx of one billion new urban dwellers by 2030, cities worldwide face the challenge of accommodating them while maintaining a high quality of life. Expanding urban centers too rapidly is unsustainable, as commuting time should ideally be limited to one hour. Additionally, allowing millions of new vehicles to enter already polluted cities would exacerbate environmental issues. Air pollution, which currently causes mortality rates five to ten times higher than road accidents, underscores the urgent need to reevaluate our urban development models.\n\nCities need to prioritize public transport and active mobility solutions to curb these problems. It's essential to recognize that roads are not solely for cars; rather, cyclists and pedestrians should take precedence over motorists. This sentiment was succinctly expressed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2012, who emphasized the importance of non-motorized transportation.\n\nThe United Nations' New World Urban Agenda echoes this sentiment by prioritizing cycling and walking over motorized vehicles. To achieve this, investment in cycling and walking infrastructures becomes crucial. Take Seville, Spain, as an inspiring example. In a compelling article by The Guardian, Seville is described as a \"poster city for sustainable transport.\" The number of bike trips in the city multiplied eleven-fold within a few years, demonstrating the efficacy of building sufficient connected and safe bike lanes.\n\nAnother noteworthy case is Buenos Aires, Argentina, which has made significant investments in cycling infrastructure. As a result, Buenos Aires was included in the list of the top 20 most bike-friendly cities. The city has built over 140 km of cycle paths to make the streets more appealing and alleviate traffic congestion by improving the efficiency of the public transport system. Ultimately, the goal is to create a city where bicycles are a common means of transportation, fostering a more vibrant and livable urban environment.\n\nDespite some success stories, many cities still prioritize car-oriented infrastructures. Local policies often allocate higher priority to parking spaces rather than cycle paths and pedestrian zones. For instance, San Francisco was found to have 441,541 parking spaces, with over half of them being free on-street spots. By reducing costly parking spaces, cities can reclaim valuable urban areas while encouraging people to adopt alternative modes of transportation, thereby reducing gas emissions.\n\nFortunately, progress is being made globally, with many cities implementing new parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for example, recently abolished minimum car parking requirements and set a maximum number of parking spots allowed for specific projects. These adjustments demonstrate how cities can make tangible progress towards sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, cities that prioritize pedestrian and cycling accessibility tend to have higher GDP per capita levels compared to those dominated by traffic. Research conducted by New Zealand University also indicates that for every dollar spent on building new separated bike lanes, cities could save up to $24 through reduced healthcare costs, less pollution, and improved traffic flow.\n\nIn the next article, we will explore the role of cycling in megacities and revisit the topic of urban sustainability, examining cases from South America and Europe.\n\nContact the author\nRecent news!\nContact Us\nAvenue des Arts, 7-8\nPostal address: Rue de la Charit\u00e9, 22\n1210 Brussels, Belgium"

Enroll in an accolade. \n\nUpgrade your browser for an enhanced experience\nYour browser is outdated. Please upgrade to improve your browsing experience.\n\n\"Social and sustainable cities = bicycle-friendly cities\" - urban planners and architects often apply this formula to create cities with a higher quality of life.\n\nCities like London and Melbourne are heavily investing in bicycle networks to address the challenges posed by traffic congestion. Bicycle manufacturers are capitalizing on the increasing popularity of urban cycling as a means to alleviate traffic congestion. Brightly colored bicycles from bike-sharing programs have become a common sight on city streets.\n\nCargo bikes have gained popularity among families due to their ability to carry heavy loads. This feature has also attracted municipal and commercial users. In recognition of this trend, EUROBIKE (held in Friedrichshafen from July 8-10, 2018) will introduce a new category focused on cargo bikes this year.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, the United Nations (UN) declared June 3 as the official World Bicycle Day. The aim is to promote cycling in all its forms and raise awareness about the multiple societal benefits of using bicycles for transportation and leisure activities. Bicycles contribute to sustainability, support school attendance, especially for girls in rural areas of Africa, and aid agricultural production in countries like Zambia.\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), operating in various countries including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, and Mexico, works globally to design and implement high-quality transport systems and policy solutions that make cities more livable, equitable, and sustainable. ITDP has successfully proposed plans for bike lane networks and bike parking infrastructure in many cities. Their efforts have led to the launch of new bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\n\nIn urban planning, a key focus is to develop bicycle-oriented concepts that provide attractive and safe infrastructure for cyclists. Planners aim to generate enthusiasm among cyclists and encourage non-cyclists to adopt biking as a mode of transportation.\n\nLondon is investing significantly in \"Cycle Superhighways,\" which are dedicated cycle routes connecting the outskirts of London to the city center. These superhighways offer safer, quicker, and more direct commuting options. Former London mayor Boris Johnson stated in 2014 that encouraging more people to cycle reduces pressure on roads, buses, and trains, cuts pollution, and improves the overall quality of life. His successor, Sadiq Khan, has committed to investing \u00a3770m in cycling over his term.\n\nMelbourne's Bicycle Plan 2016-2020, titled \"A Connected City,\" prioritizes safe cycling in urban planning. The plan aims to create a well-connected network for all age groups, ensuring easy access to services and opportunities in a cleaner and less congested city.\n\nXiamen, a port city in southeastern China, boasts the world's longest cycle path. Spanning 7.6 km, this skyway connects major residential and business districts, running beneath the existing bus-overland transportation system. It features parking spaces and rental options for bicycles. The project was inspired by Danish architecture studio DISSING + WEITLING, renowned for their successful Cycle Superhighways and The Bicycle Snake projects in Copenhagen.\n\nIn Eindhoven, the Netherlands, futuristic elements can be seen in the Hovenring bicycle bridge, suspended 70 meters above the ground, offering a unique cycling experience. Another notable project is the Van Gogh Path, illuminated with patterns based on Vincent van Gogh's famous painting \"The Starry Night.\"\n\nBicycle manufacturers continuously innovate to meet the growing demand for urban cycling. They offer a wide range of products, including e-bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and belt-drive bikes for private, commercial, and municipal use.\n\nBrian Hohl, an industrial designer and inventor from DIAVELO - Protanium B.V (Accell Group), emphasizes the importance of integrating light and compact lithium batteries into electric bicycles. The design philosophy focuses on creating visually appealing, user-friendly electric bikes accessible to everyone. Protanium collaborated on the EBIKE4DELIVERY project, aiming to promote greener and healthier jobs by using cargo bikes for meal delivery across Europe. Delivery services utilizing heavy-duty cargo bikes are gaining popularity worldwide.\n\nIn Germany, major parcel service providers such as DHL, dpd, GLS, Hermes, and UPS have established shared micro-depots equipped with cargo bikes. These cargo bikes replace motorized delivery vehicles, reducing congestion on the roads. The bike-sharing market in Europe is primarily dominated by Chinese providers such as Mobike, Obike, Ofo, and Yobike. Despite challenges, these companies are expanding aggressively in Europe and the USA, introducing dockless rental bikes to promote cycling and reduce car usage.\n\nWhile the growth of bike sharing has faced regulatory challenges in North America, it continues to thrive in other parts of the world. Data collected through bike-sharing services is utilized to optimize transportation options in smart cities. This trend is expected to extend beyond bicycles and encompass e-scooters, semi-automated shuttle buses, and other last-mile solutions, enhancing individual mobility.\n\nLegal Notice"

      "text": "A Sustainable Metric for Evaluating Bike-Friendly Cities in the United States\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, I'm constantly astounded by the inefficiency of commuting within the borough without a bike. The subway system is largely focused on routes leading to Manhattan, making intra-borough transportation less convenient. Opting for biking often presents a more efficient alternative to the subway. Whether we are avid cyclists ourselves, acquainted with someone who rides or simply annoyed by bicyclists, it's worth considering how cities plan for bikers \u2013 or don't.\n\nWhile we have the ability to make individual decisions regarding our mode of transport, these choices are heavily influenced by the broader transportation infrastructure, which determines the accessibility and convenience of roads, subways, and bike lanes. Such decisions carry tremendous weight, as transportation accounts for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, it significantly impacts public health due to pollution exposure and the lack of physical activity. In fact, the World Health Organization reports that 11 percent of annual deaths worldwide are linked to physical inactivity, obesity, and overweight conditions.\n\nIn an attempt to understand bicycle commuting in the 35 largest U.S. cities better, I was eager to explore what strategies cities employ to facilitate biking and identify areas for improvement. A recent sustainability indicators class, taught by Alex de Sherbinin, a renowned environmental data analyst, and associate director for science applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University, provided an excellent opportunity to delve into these questions.\n\nThe course primarily focused on sustainability indicators \u2013 methods to assess the sustainability of social, economic, and environmental systems. By consolidating various indicators, we can generate aggregate measures, also referred to as indexes or indices. Sustainability indicators are vital to distill vast amounts of data from disparate sources into concise conclusions that educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and curious individuals can easily interpret. Additionally, facilitating knowledge-sharing among decision-makers is a crucial tool for enhancing urban infrastructure and fostering more environmentally and socially resilient cities.\n\nMy endeavor was driven by the aspiration to create an index that recognizes the interconnectedness between socioeconomic factors and the environment. While many existing rankings assess the bicycle-friendliness of U.S. cities, the majority overlook key environmental health considerations. Addressing air pollution may not be the foremost concern when thinking about improving bicycle infrastructure, but incorporating public health indicators is paramount for comprehensive and meaningful sustainability assessment. This holistic perspective is essential for understanding environmental health issues, vulnerability, and cultivating community resilience.\n\nFurthermore, my index takes into account social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To foster a well-rounded approach, I incorporated indicators such as the availability of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of full-time employees dedicated to bicycle-related matters in each city, and average exposure levels to three major air pollutants. Additionally, city infrastructure and safety were considered through factors like the length of bicycle infrastructure (including bike lanes, routes, and pathways) relative to city size, the number of bicycles available through bike sharing programs per total population, and cyclist fatality rates. It's important to note that sustainability indexes exclude indicators that cities cannot directly manipulate, such as topographical challenges or extreme temperatures.\n\nTo construct the index, I gathered data from three reputable sources: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists. I also sought input from experts within and outside the academic community to determine the most critical and relevant indicators. After conducting various statistical analyses and computations to minimize biases and standardize data, the final step was aggregating all indicators into one comprehensive index, involving normalization and weighting of each indicator.\n\nAnalyzing the compiled data enables us to determine the bike-friendliness rankings of the largest U.S. cities, accounting for various factors. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver emerged as highly bike-friendly, whereas San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City ranked considerably lower.\n\nMoreover, the index uncovers patterns in the data, illustrating the correlations between different indicators. Notably, the data highlights a negative correlation between the rate of bike commuting and cyclist fatality rates. In other words, cities with higher rates of bike commuting tend to exhibit lower rates of cyclist deaths, and vice versa. This finding provides a compelling argument for policymakers to push for enhanced infrastructure that encourages higher numbers of bike commuters.\n\nClimate change not only disrupts environmental cycles but also alters our perspectives on the environment. Sustainability indicators offer a fresh outlook on our relationship with the built and natural environment, enabling us to envision a more resilient future. How we envision the future shapes our actions and influences the trajectory of climate change. Therefore, using sustainability indices to improve access to alternative transportation methods, cities can promote cycling and, consequently, contribute to transforming climate cycles.\n\nThis article has been republished with permission from Earth Institute, Columbia University.

      "text": "Riding your bike for sustainable transportation is not only good for the environment but also offers numerous benefits for individuals and communities. By encouraging more people to embrace cycling, we can have a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating greener, more livable cities.\n\nTransportation is responsible for nearly 25% of global carbon emissions, primarily due to the high usage of motor vehicles in urban areas. However, it's worth noting that most trips are typically shorter than 10km, which is a reasonable distance to cover on a bike. By choosing to ride a bicycle or an ebike, we can significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A research study conducted by the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of California, Davis, suggests that if bikes and ebikes were used for 22% of all transport trips worldwide, greenhouse gas emissions and energy use could be reduced by 47% by 2050.\n\nIn addition to being environmentally friendly, cycling is also space-efficient. It requires less infrastructure and space compared to motor vehicles, allowing for more green spaces and trees in our cities. This, in turn, helps combat issues such as heat generation and water displacement caused by impermeable surfaces.\n\nOne way to make a positive impact right away is by opting for biking as your daily mode of commuting. According to a report by the Queensland Government, riding your bike to work, covering a distance of 10km each way, can save approximately 1,500kg of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Furthermore, choosing to bike instead of driving can help alleviate motor vehicle congestion, which accounts for 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gases across Australia's major cities. To support people in making biking their preferred mode of transport, programs like Ride2Work provide essential resources and knowledge to get started with bike commuting, helping both individuals and organizations promote this sustainable practice.\n\nCycling is not limited to commuting alone; it is also ideal for local trips to places such as schools, shops, pools, or gyms. By equipping your bike with a basket or panniers, you can easily carry your belongings while enjoying a healthy and eco-friendly way of getting around town. The Ride2School program focuses specifically on using bikes for school commutes, offering comprehensive resources for families and helping foster a culture of cycling within educational institutions.\n\nWhile individual efforts play a vital role, governments need to step up and create infrastructure that supports cycling. Developing extensive networks of bike lanes and paths not only promotes cycling but also makes it easier and safer for people to choose bikes as a transportation option. Local governments have been at the forefront of these initiatives, with many displaying a vision for sustainable transport. The Compact of Mayors, a global coalition committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, includes Australian metropolitan mayors like Clover Moore of Sydney and Robert Doyle of Melbourne. Cities like Melbourne have implemented plans, such as the Walking Plan and Bicycle Plan, aiming to improve access to the central business district (CBD). Additionally, they have also introduced Last Kilometre Freight Plans, exploring sustainable alternatives like bicycle couriers for deliveries within the city.\n\nRecognizing the significance of creating livable cities, national leadership has shown bipartisan political support in recent years. In 2015, the Turnbull Coalition Government established a Ministry for Cities, aligning with the opposition's Shadow Ministry for Cities, Infrastructure, and Transport. Leaders like Greens Senator Janet Rice emphasize the importance of prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transport, calling for concrete action and strategic implementation of sustainable plans. Organizations like Bicycle Network go a step further, urging the federal government to establish the first national bicycle infrastructure fund in Australia, unlocking a multitude of health, economic, and livability benefits associated with bike-friendly cities.\n\nBy embracing cycling as a sustainable and efficient means of transportation, we can make a difference in reducing carbon emissions, promoting healthier lifestyles, and building greener and more inclusive cities. Let's ride towards a future where bikes are not just recreational tools but integral components of our daily lives and urban landscapes."

      "text": "Why Biking is Essential for Creating Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nCycling has long been recognized as an efficient mode of transportation with the potential to contribute to the development of more sustainable cities. Not only does it offer numerous benefits, but it also plays a vital role in shaping environmentally conscious communities. Let's explore three key advantages of cycling and bicycle networks that help foster environmentally sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nCompared to other modes of transportation, bicycles require minimal energy for production. For example, data from 2008 revealed that a carbon-framed road bicycle weighing 7.2kg consumes only 11,546,658,000 Joules of energy during its manufacturing process, while a 'generic car' demands a staggering 118,284,466,000 Joules (Figures via WattzOn). Although variations exist based on bicycle type and external factors, the overall embodied energy of bikes remains significantly lower.\n\nMoreover, constructing bicycle lanes necessitates less energy-intensive processes than building roads for automobiles. Bicycle lanes occupy less space, require reduced foundations and materials, and entail less energy-intensive maintenance. This highlights the resource-efficient nature of biking infrastructure, contributing to the overall sustainability of cities.\n\nAir Quality Enhancement\nThe environmental benefits of cycling extend beyond energy efficiency. Each individual who switches from a private, polluting mode of transport to a bicycle \u2013 a zero-emission vehicle during use \u2013 contributes to reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality in cities. The impact becomes even more significant when more people choose cycling as their primary mode of transportation.\n\nWhen individuals shift from driving cars to riding bikes, they not only minimize their personal carbon footprint but also directly contribute to reduced carbon emissions. In cities where cycling is already a popular alternative, achieving such a modal shift is more feasible. Establishing an enhanced network of bicycle infrastructure, alongside other supporting measures, fosters improvements in air quality, greatly benefiting urban environments.\n\nMitigating Noise Pollution\nPollution encompasses not only emissions but also excessive noise levels, which pose long-term health risks. Studies have shown that noise can increase stress hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the human body, even during sleep, potentially causing severe physiological problems. Some cities are now prioritizing noise pollution reduction as part of their sustainability agendas.\n\nVancouver's 2020 action plan, dubbed \"the world's greenest,\" envisions a highly sustainable future for the city, aiming for \"less pollution and cleaner air, less machine noise and more birdsong.\" While it may sound somewhat utopian, the fact that noise pollution reduction is being actively considered speaks to its significance. The report recognizes an increase in cycling as integral to community development, subtly indicating the role of bicycles in reducing noise pollution.\n\nWhile bicycle networks and cycling itself cannot single-handedly solve all urban challenges \u2013 as that would be overly simplistic \u2013 they play a crucial role. Urban air quality analysis is multifaceted, dependent on various factors such as weather, geography, and industry, over which bicycle networks have no control. Nevertheless, cities that prioritize bicycles over automated modes of transport require less energy, emit fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise, contributing to their long-term sustainability.\n\nPhoto: lopify.

      "text": "Promoting Urban Sustainability with the Modest Bicycle\n\nArticle:\n\nUrban Sustainability and the Modest Bicycle\n\nAs American society grapples with pressing issues like obesity, traffic congestion, reduced family time, and social isolation in city centers, it becomes crucial to ponder how we arrived at this point and how we can bring about positive change. Having spent three months in Europe last summer, I speak not only for myself but also for fellow Americans who have marveled at the high quality of living in those places\u2014particularly in comparison to the soulless, car-dependent cities of the United States. The reasons behind our heavy reliance on cars and the resulting health crisis lie in the historical neglect of alternative modes of transportation, such as streetcars and bicycles, which were once prevalent in American towns with populations exceeding 10,000 until the 1930s. Nowadays, several European cities, notably Amsterdam and Copenhagen, stand as beacons of sustainable urban transportation due to their effective utilization of the simple bicycle.\n\nEconomic Impact of Cycling and Health Benefits\n\nIn Denmark, publicly-funded universal healthcare has spurred investment in promoting bicycle usage, given the well-known and accepted health benefits associated with cycling. Research indicates that adults who commute to work by bicycle experience a 30% reduction in mortality rates. Copenhagen estimates annual healthcare savings of $100 million, without factoring in societal gains from increased productivity resulting from a healthier workforce. Additionally, there are additional savings in road maintenance costs and reduced congestion. Notably, in Copenhagen, building grade-separated bike paths costs approximately $2 million per mile on each side, yet these expenses are fully offset within five years. An economic impact study conducted by the city indicates that every mile cycled yields a net gain of 21 cents for society, while driving a car results in a net loss of 12 cents per mile. These figures encompass both public sector savings and the rise in private sector economic activity.\n\nBicycle Commuting and Urban Sustainability\n\nPresently, more people commute to work via bicycle in greater Copenhagen than the entire United States combined, with an average commuting distance of 3 \u00bd miles each way. Over the past three decades, Copenhagen has gradually reclaimed car-parking spaces and road areas to make way for dedicated bike infrastructure.\n\nIn the Netherlands, where the bicycle culture is perhaps the most inclusive globally, the Dutch Cycling Embassy, a public-private organization, capitalizes on the highly acclaimed Dutch model of urban transportation. It promotes urban mobility to business and government leaders worldwide who seek solutions to urbanization, city revitalization, and transit sustainability challenges. The Dutch possess firsthand experience attesting to the direct contributions of bicycles towards improved health, urban livability, road safety, cleaner air, enhanced traffic flow, reduced social isolation, and a thriving economy.\n\nMarketing the Bicycle as a Feasible Transit Option\n\nIn the United States, transforming the bicycle into a viable form of transit starts with reshaping the image of cyclists themselves. They should be regarded as regular citizens rather than members of a subculture. Danish consulting firm Copenhagenize provides advice to cities on fostering positive perceptions of bikes and urban mobility through behavioral changes and marketing campaigns. Its very name embodies the concept of creating \"complete streets,\" akin to the American non-profit organization and movement called \"Complete Streets,\" which has successfully influenced progress in several U.S. cities.\n\nEnhancing Urban Fabric and Restoring Downtown Vitality\n\nAs our cities face financial constraints at the state and federal levels, vacant sidewalks, and dilemmas regarding accommodating future growth, leaders are seeking models for sustainable development. Look no further than the popular tourist hubs of Amsterdam and Copenhagen for value-driven solutions. Like many cities in the U.S., these urban centers have limited land availability for expansion. Thus, achieving long-term vitality necessitates focusing development within existing, built-up areas. Today's singles and young families increasingly desire vibrant town life characterized by safe pedestrian and bicycle paths through downtowns adorned with diverse shops, entertainment options, and urban amenities. As demonstrated by the Dutch and Danish urban models, substantial numbers of people would readily embrace routine bicycle use if our cities incorporated proper and extensive biking infrastructure. The unassuming bicycle holds the key to smart growth in America, all while preserving our love affair with cars."

      "text": "Title: Top 20 Bike-Friendly Cities Worldwide, Ranked\n\nArticle:\nAs trends come and go, it's the timeless simplicity of biking that continues to dominate urban mobility. Amidst the ever-changing landscape of autonomous cars and dockless pogosticks, the bicycle stands out as the most efficient, practical, and reliable solution for urban transportation. Recognizing this, cities worldwide are investing in infrastructure and expanding facilities to embrace biking as an everyday mode of transport and enhance urban livability.\n\nTo analyze and acknowledge the pro-cycling efforts of cities globally, we present the Copenhagenize Index\u2014a comprehensive ranking of the world's most bike-friendly cities. This biennial index, in its fifth edition since 2011, evaluates and ranks over 115 cities across the globe using 14 parameters focused on ambition, culture, and streetscape design. (Read our methodology here.)\n\nThe competition for the top spots remains fierce, with Copenhagen continuing to hold the first position. However, Amsterdam has recently taken second place from Utrecht, thanks to its bold initiatives. All three cities serve as role models for other bike-friendly competition. Moreover, beyond Denmark and the Netherlands, other cities are also stepping up their game when it comes to prioritizing bicycles. Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux closely follow the leading trio in the rankings. Oslo has made substantial progress in the past four years, while newcomers like Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are showcasing how urban centers can be transformed into better places for cyclists. Just outside the top 20, several cities are on the edge of breaking through, necessitating sustained investment and implementation of innovative bike infrastructure to improve their rankings in the future.\n\nWithout further ado, let's discover the top 20 bicycle-friendly cities in the world:\n\n1. Copenhagen\n2. Amsterdam\n3. Utrecht\n4. Antwerp\n5. Strasbourg\n6. Bordeaux\n7. Oslo\n8. Bogot\u00e1\n9. Bremen\n10. Taipei\n11. Vancouver\n12. Barcelona\n13. Vienna\n14. Berlin\n15. Malmo\n16. Tokyo\n17. Paris\n18. Munich\n19. Helsinki\n20. Montreal\n\nLet's delve into two of these exemplary bike-friendly cities:\n\nCopenhagen:\nWith impressive figures to back its commitment, Copenhagen leads the pack. A remarkable 62 percent of its inhabitants choose cycling for their daily commutes to work or school. Cyclists in Copenhagen cover an astounding 894,000 miles every day. The city invests over $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure, constructing four bicycle bridges and more than 104 miles of new regional cycle highways. In addition, political support for cycling was evident in the 2018 municipal elections, where parties promoting car-centric policies saw no success. However, limitations on municipal spending imposed by the national government have threatened the expansion of cycling infrastructure. Moreover, sustainable mobility lacks strong political leadership since the latest election, resulting in a decreased priority for cycling investments, even falling below car parking considerations. To retain its global pioneer status, Copenhagen must navigate this challenging situation and find ways to prioritize cycling in the years ahead.\n\nAmsterdam:\nIn 2019, Amsterdam staged an impressive comeback after dropping to third place in the previous index. As a bustling Dutch capital, it exemplifies how a city can recognize setbacks and rebound successfully. Amsterdam has developed an ambitious plan for 2022, centered around enhancing bicycle parking and existing infrastructure. With a continuous influx of 11,000 new residents annually, the city is creating new \"royal routes\" to accommodate growing numbers of bicycles. During rush hour, efforts are being made to reduce stress by widening existing cycle tracks to more than eight feet, constructing low-speed cycle streets, and redesigning major intersections to ensure protected cycling space. However, the real test lies in transitioning plans into tangible actions. By implementing additional bicycle connections, improving facilities, providing clearer wayfinding, and enforcing moped regulations within cycle tracks, Amsterdam aims to reclaim the throne from Copenhagen in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, these top 20 bike-friendly cities demonstrate their dedication to promoting cycling as a viable means of commuting and improving urban environments. Beyond rankings, they set an example for other cities worldwide, illustrating how investing in cycling infrastructure can lead to enhanced livability, greater sustainability, and improved quality of life for all."

      "text": "Why are bicycles crucial for creating liveable and sustainable cities?\n\nThe role of cycling in designing sustainable cities cannot be overstated. The upcoming Velo-city 2018 conference is dedicated to exploring this topic in depth. With a focus on urban planning, infrastructure, and other issues related to urban development, such as traffic congestion, the conference aims to drive the discussion forward. In the meantime, let's take a brief look at what creating sustainable cities means in terms of cycling.\n\nBy 2030, cities across the globe will have to accommodate a billion new residents who move in search of employment, improved economic opportunities, and a vibrant social life. However, the current rate of urban expansion is unsustainable, and we need to impose a limit on daily commuting time\u2014perhaps one hour. Additionally, it is not feasible to allow millions of new cars to enter our already polluted urban centers. Studies have shown that air pollution causes between five to ten times more deaths than road accidents. To address these challenges, we must reconsider our existing urban development models, focusing on strengthening public transport and promoting active mobility.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor M. Bloomberg emphasized the significance of cyclists and pedestrians by stating, \"Roads are not for cars.\" His sustainable plan for the city recognized the importance of prioritizing alternative modes of transportation over motorized vehicles. This view is echoed by the United Nations' New World Urban Agenda, which places cycling and walking at the forefront while deemphasizing the use of motorized transportation. To achieve this shift, significant investments in cycling and pedestrian infrastructures are essential.\n\nAn exemplary city in this regard is Seville, which has become a poster city for sustainable transport. In just a few years, the number of bike trips in Seville increased eleven-fold. It serves as an encouraging example, along with more traditional cases such as the Netherlands and Denmark, where building sufficient interconnected and safe lanes has successfully attracted many people to cycling.\n\nBuenos Aires is another city that stands out for its progressive approach. Through substantial investments in cycling infrastructure, the city has made it onto the list of the top 20 most bike-friendly cities. More than 140 km of new bike paths have been constructed, aiming to make the city more appealing and reduce traffic congestion by developing an efficient public transport system. The ultimate goal is to create a livable city where bicycles become a common mode of transportation.\n\nDespite these success stories, motorized vehicles still receive heavy subsidies in terms of urban infrastructure. Local policies often prioritize parking spaces over cycle paths or pedestrianized zones. Consider San Francisco, for instance, where a study conducted in 2010 revealed the existence of 441,541 parking spaces, with more than half of them being free on-street spaces. Reducing the emphasis on costly parking spaces not only reclaims urban space but also encourages people to adopt alternative modes of transport, leading to reduced gas emissions. While there is much work to be done, progress is evident worldwide, as many cities have implemented new parking policies. For example, S\u00e3o Paulo has abolished minimum car parking requirements and set limits on the number of parking spots allowed in specific projects.\n\nFurthermore, cities with high accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists tend to have a 38% higher GDP per capita compared to cities dominated by car traffic. Research conducted by New Zealand universities shows that every dollar invested in building separated bike lanes can result in savings of up to $24 due to reduced healthcare costs, pollution, and traffic. However, investments remain limited, undermining their effectiveness in fostering positive changes in people's habits and perceptions of safety.\n\nIn the next article, we will explore cycling in megacities, examining cases from South America and Europe to delve deeper into the subject of urban sustainability.\n\n[1] Source: New York Post - Bloomberg says mass transit, cyclists more important than drivers\n[2] More information can be found at Citiscope - Cycling can help new urban agendas more than you'd think\n[3] UN World Urban Agenda, Paragraph 114 - priority given to safe, efficient, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure for public transport, walking, and cycling over private motorized transportation.\n[4] Copenhagenizeindex, 2015 - Buenos Aires ranked as the best city in Latin America for cycling\n[5] Read more about it in Ciclosfera - Copenhagenize Buenos Aires, the best city in Latin America for cycling (in Spanish)\n[6] Article in Italian - Redesigning human-sized cities\nContact the author\nRecent news!\nContact Us\nAvenue des Arts, 7-8\nPostal address: Rue de la Charit\u00e9, 22\n1210 Brussels, Belgium"

Bicycle manufacturers are tapping into this urban cycling trend, contributing to the liberation of cities from traffic congestion. The emergence of bike-sharing programs with their brightly colored bikes has become a common sight on city streets.\nCargo bikes have earned praise from families due to their ability to carry heavy loads efficiently. These versatile bicycles, equipped with robust electric motors, are also gaining popularity among municipal and commercial users. Consequently, EUROBIKE (scheduled to be held in Friedrichshafen from 8-10 July 2018) will introduce a dedicated Cargo category for the first time this year.\nOn April 12, 2018, the United Nations (UN) declared June 3 as the annual World Bicycle Day. The primary objective of this day is to raise awareness about the numerous societal benefits of using bicycles for transportation and leisure activities.\nBrook Boyer, who considers bicycles to be more than just a means of urban mobility, firmly believes in the significance of such a day. He states, \"Bicycles are the ultimate vehicle for progress.\" Bicycles contribute to sustainable consumption and production, support school attendance, particularly among girls in rural parts of Africa, and even aid agricultural production in countries like Zambia, where the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has deployed 4,500 bikes for this purpose.\nImage: The \"Come on Let's Bike\" initiative aims to reduce the gender gap in bicycling in Syria.\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), headquartered in New York and operating globally with offices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, and Mexico, plays a crucial role in designing and implementing high-quality transportation systems. ITDP's objective is to create livable, equitable, and sustainable cities. They have successfully proposed bike lane networks and bike parking plans in various cities, collaborating with local authorities to bring these plans to fruition. Recently, they have been instrumental in the launch of new bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\nThe contemporary concepts developed by urban planners and architects often prioritize user attractiveness and perceived traffic safety. The focus lies in creating a forgiving infrastructure that generates enthusiasm for cyclists. Encouraging greater bicycle usage among both current cyclists and non-cyclists should be a shared goal.\nLondon is increasingly investing in \"Cycle Superhighways,\" which are dedicated cycle routes connecting outer London to the city centre. Compared to the existing \"Quietways,\" Cycle Superhighways offer safer, faster, and more direct journeys, making them the preferred choice for commuting. Former London mayor Boris Johnson commented in 2014 when the first superhighways were opened, stating, \"Getting more people on their bikes will reduce pressure on roads, buses, and trains, cut pollution, and enhance everyone's lives.\" Sadiq Khan, Johnson's successor, has committed \u00a3770m over four years to further promote cycling. The segregated cycle paths within the Superhighway network have already made a noticeable impact in reducing car traffic.\nIn Melbourne, Australia, the Bicycle Plan 2016-2020, named \"A Connected City,\" focuses on safe cycling in urban planning, emphasizing the goals of the metropolitan area. The plan aims to facilitate safe and convenient movement for residents, allowing them to access all services and opportunities offered by the municipality. The objective is to develop a comprehensive network catering to all age groups, leading to a cleaner and less congested city.\nXiamen, located on the southeastern coast of China, boasts the world's longest bicycle path, spanning 7.6 km. This skyway connects major residential and business districts and runs beneath Xiamen's existing bus-overland transportation system. Accommodating more than 2000 bicycles, it is linked to 11 bus stations and two subway stations. Additionally, there are rental bikes available alongside parking spaces for privately owned bikes. The innovative project was designed by Danish architecture studio DISSING + WEITLING, renowned for their successful projects such as Copenhagen's Cycle Superhighways and The Bicycle Snake.\nImage: The Hovenring bicycle bridge in Eindhoven, the Netherlands facilitates futuristic cycling experiences, suspended 70 meters above the ground. Designed by ipv Delft, the bridge serves as a landmark for the city.\nThe bicycle manufacturing industry supports the urban cycling trend by offering diverse products for every segment, including e-bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and belt-drive bikes. These solutions cater to private, commercial, and municipal users.\nBrian Hohl, industrial designer and inventor from DIAVELO - Protanium B.V (Accell Group), highlights the importance of integrating light, compact lithium batteries in electric bicycles. Their design philosophy focuses on creating visually appealing and user-friendly electric bikes that are accessible to all. He emphasizes the need for seamlessly integrated yet detachable batteries for convenient charging. Protanium actively invests its expertise in projects like EBIKE4DELIVERY, aiming to create greener and healthier job opportunities while enabling eco-friendly meal delivery across Europe. The use of cargo bikes for package delivery is rapidly gaining popularity worldwide, contributing to the reduction of motorized vehicles on the roads.\nLeading parcel service providers in Germany, including DHL, dpd, GLS, Hermes, and UPS, have established a shared transshipment point comprising twelve cargo bikes in Pankow district. The micro-depots, occupying a 14-square-meter space each, enable efficient last-mile deliveries within a radius of three to five kilometers. Cargo bikes effectively replace traditional delivery vehicles, alleviating road congestion.\nImage: China and Taiwan serve as the primary producers of bicycles, accounting for around 90% of global production. Each year, approximately 30 million bicycles and Electric Power-Assisted Cycles (EPACs) are sold in Europe alone, with 13 million produced within the EU.\nChina has witnessed a significant shift in transportation preferences towards cars over the past two years, challenging major Chinese cities. With over 200 cities projected to have populations exceeding one million by 2030, many cities are turning to increased bike-sharing initiatives to combat the dominance of cars. This development has led to rapid growth in the supply market within this segment.\nAsian providers such as Mobike, Obike, Ofo, and Yobike are presenting formidable competition to established companies like Call-a-bike (Deutsche Bahn), Jump Bikes, Nice Ride, and Nextbike. Mobike, for instance, expanded its rental bike system to Manchester in 2017 and has since deployed 700 bikes in Berlin. The company continues to pursue aggressive expansion plans in Europe and the USA.\nHowever, the Chinese bike-sharing boom did not meet expectations and resulted in oversaturated cities with insufficient infrastructure and regulations. Abandoned dockless rental bikes have posed challenges, blocking busy streets in major cities, which European cities aim to avoid.\nThere have been concerns about service providers utilizing the collected data for specific purposes, given the profitability challenges faced by bike-sharing companies. Smartphone-controlled smart biking is becoming popular, opening up possibilities for more intelligent urban mobility solutions. The trend is extending beyond bicycles and e-bikes, with e-scooters and semi-automated shuttle buses contributing to individual mobility in smart cities.\nLegal Notice"

      "text": "Enhancing Bike Friendliness: A Sustainable Indicator for Comparing U.S. Cities\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, I'm continually fascinated by the efficiency of biking as a mode of transportation within the borough compared to other options like the subway. The subway system primarily concentrates on connecting routes to Manhattan, making intra-borough transport less convenient. Bicycles offer a more effective means of getting around, whether we choose to bike ourselves, have friends who do, or simply observe the cycling community.\n\nWhile individual transportation choices are important, it is equally crucial to consider the broader context of transportation infrastructure. The accessibility and ease of roads, subway routes, and bike lanes play a significant role in determining how people choose to travel. These decisions have far-reaching implications because transportation accounts for approximately one-quarter of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Moreover, it significantly affects public health, influencing pollution exposure and physical activity levels. Worldwide, 11 percent of annual deaths are associated with physical inactivity, being overweight, and obesity, as reported by the World Health Organization.\n\nIn my quest to explore bicycle commuting in the largest U.S. cities, I was eager to investigate what initiatives these cities have embraced to facilitate cycling and identify potential areas for improvement. This desire inspired me to delve into sustainability indicators during a recent class. Our instructor, Alex de Sherbinin, an environmental data analyst and Associate Director for Science Applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia, guided our study of sustainability indicators\u2014tools used to measure the sustainability of social, economic, and environmental systems. By amalgamating multiple indicators, we can create aggregate indexes that provide concise and easily interpretable conclusions for educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and inquisitive individuals around the world. Additionally, fostering opportunities for decision-makers to exchange experiences is vital for improving urban infrastructure, helping cities become more environmentally and socially resilient.\n\nMy motivation was to construct an index that recognizes the interconnectedness between socioeconomic factors and the environment. Although several existing rankings assess the bicycle friendliness of U.S. cities, the majority overlook essential environmental health criteria. While addressing air pollution may not be the primary consideration in improving bicycle infrastructure, incorporating public health indicators is pivotal for achieving sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach. Such \"systems thinking\" is instrumental in understanding environmental health issues, vulnerability, and fostering community resiliency.\n\nMy index comprehensively considers various aspects, including social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To adopt this holistic perspective, I incorporated indicators such as the presence of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of full-time employees managing bicycle-related matters, average exposure to three harmful air pollutants, miles of bicycle infrastructure relative to city size, availability of bicycles through bike share programs per population, and bicyclist fatality rates. Sustainability indexes exclude factors outside cities' direct control, such as hilly terrain or extreme temperatures.\n\nGathering data from valuable sources like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists, along with insights from academic and non-academic communities, I ensured the index included indicators perceived as important and relevant. Employing statistical analyses and computations to reduce bias and standardize data, I consolidated all indicators into a comprehensive index, capturing a city's overall bicycle friendliness.\n\nThis aggregated data enables us to evaluate and rank the country's largest cities based on their bicycle friendliness. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver emerged as leaders in this aspect, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City fell lower in the rankings.\n\nFurthermore, examining patterns within the data uncovers correlations between different indicators. For instance, a noteworthy implication is the negative correlation between bicycle commuting rates and cyclist fatality rates. In simpler terms, cities with higher rates of bicycle commuters tend to have lower cyclist fatality rates and vice versa. This finding serves as a compelling argument for policymakers to advocate for infrastructure improvements that promote increased bicycle commuting.\n\nClimate change not only transforms our natural environment but also alters our perspective towards it. Similarly, sustainability indicators provide a fresh outlook on our relationship with both the built and natural environment, enabling us to visualize a more resilient future. Our vision shapes our actions, which, in turn, influence the trajectory of climate change. Therefore, by utilizing sustainability indexes to enhance access to alternative modes of transportation, cities can encourage cycling and contribute to changing the cycles of climate change.\n\nThis article is republished with permission from the Earth Institute, Columbia University.

      "text": "Title:\nPromoting Sustainable Transportation through Biking\n\nArticle:\n\nProven Strategies & Valuable Resources\nCan cycling contribute to mitigating global warming? Absolutely! When more individuals embrace biking as a form of sustainable transportation, we can make a significant impact. Let's explore some effective tips and resources for promoting and adopting biking as a means of travel.\n\nThe Environmental Impact of Transportation\nTransportation is responsible for approximately 25% of global carbon emissions, mainly due to the prevalent use of high-emission motor vehicles in cities. Surprisingly, most trips are under 10 kilometers, which is a reasonable distance for biking or connecting to public transport systems conveniently.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of California, Davis, their modeling studies demonstrate that if bikes and electric bikes (ebikes) constituted 22% of all transportation trips worldwide, we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by an impressive 47% by 2050. Encouragingly, this reduction would have a positive impact on combating global warming.\n\nSpace-Efficient and Green\nOne of the remarkable advantages of cycling is its space efficiency. By embracing biking, we create more room for trees, green spaces, and reduce the need for large areas paved with heat-retaining and water-displacing impermeable surfaces. Biking supports sustainability by optimizing land utilization and preserving natural environments.\n\nCommute Sustainably\nYou have the power to lessen your ecological footprint by transforming it into a trail left by bike tires as you commute. According to a Queensland Government report, riding your bike to work over a mere 10-kilometer distance each way could save an astounding 1,500 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Additionally, it helps alleviate the motor vehicle congestion that currently adds 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gases across Australia\u2019s major cities.\n\nTo assist people in fully utilizing bikes for their daily commute, there's Ride2Work. This program is dedicated to providing essential knowledge on how to start commuting by bike and inspire others to do the same. Find valuable resources and guidance on the official Ride2Work website.\n\nShort Local Trips Made Easy\nBiking is also ideal for short trips to nearby destinations such as schools, shops, pools, and gyms. Equip your bike with a basket or panniers to conveniently carry your belongings during these local adventures. Enjoy the benefits of incorporating exercise into daily tasks and reducing congestion on the roads.\n\nThe Ride2School program focuses on promoting safe biking practices for school journeys. Explore the Ride2School website for invaluable resources catering to families and discover ways to foster a bicycle-friendly culture within your school.\n\nThe Joy of Sustainable Urban Living\nCreating sustainable cities necessitates the development of extensive networks of bike lanes and paths, facilitating increased bike usage among the population. Remarkably, initiatives led by local governments have already showcased visionary commitments toward sustainable transportation.\n\nAn international coalition known as the Compact of Mayors, spearheads efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change, attracting two Australian metropolitan mayors: Clover Moore of Sydney and Robert Doyle of Melbourne. The Guardian highlights their endeavors towards sustainable urban development.\n\nCities like Melbourne possess key plans such as Walking Plan and Bicycle Plan, aiming to improve access to the central business district while enhancing diversity. Furthermore, Melbourne has initiated a Last Kilometer Freight Plan, focusing on replacing motor vehicle deliveries with more sustainable options like bicycle couriers.\n\nAddressing urban liveability has now become a bipartisan political agenda. In 2015, the Turnbull Coalition Government established a Ministry for Cities, aligning with the Shadow Ministry for Cities, Infrastructure, and Transport proposed by the opposition. Both sides recognize the importance of prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transport as part of urban planning.\n\nHighlighting the crucial need for leadership, Greens Senator Janet Rice emphasizes the importance of setting clear goals and implementing measures that prioritize sustainable modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit. Bicycle Network echoes this sentiment and urges the federal government to establish Australia's first national bicycle infrastructure fund to unlock substantial health, economic, and liveability benefits associated with creating bike-friendly cities."

      "text": "Why Cycling is Key to Achieving Environmental Sustainability in Cities\n\nCycling has long been hailed as an energy-efficient mode of transportation with the potential to transform cities into more sustainable and eco-friendly environments. But what exactly are the benefits it brings, and how does it contribute to urban development? Moreover, what about the environmental impact and advantages of the cycling infrastructure needed for thriving bike networks in cities? In this article, we will delve into three primary benefits of cycling and its infrastructure, highlighting their vital role in creating environmentally sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nCompared to other modes of transport, bicycles require minuscule amounts of energy to produce. Back in 2008, data from the United States showed that manufacturing a 7.2kg road bicycle with a carbon frame consumed only 11,546,658,000 Joules of energy, while producing a \"generic car\" gobbled up a staggering 118,284,466,000 Joules (Figures via WattzOn). Even accounting for variations depending on bicycle type and external factors, it remains clear that bikes have significantly lower embodied energy than cars.\n\nFurthermore, constructing bicycle lanes requires less energy than building roads for automobiles. These lanes occupy less space, necessitate reduced foundations and material requirements, and demand less energy-intensive maintenance. As such, investing in bicycle infrastructure not only promotes energy efficiency but also helps create a physically resilient and sustainable urban landscape.\n\nAir Quality Enhancement\nThe environmental sustainability of bicycles extends beyond their energy efficiency. When individuals switch from private, polluting forms of transportation to bicycles \u2013 a zero-emission means of travel \u2013 cities experience reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. If a substantial number of people transition to cycling, these benefits become even more tangible for city dwellers.\n\nEach person opting for a bicycle ride instead of driving a car effectively reduces their personal carbon footprint and overall carbon emissions. To make cycling a truly compelling alternative to other modes of transport, as witnessed in some cities already, the promotion of an enhanced bicycle network becomes pivotal. By integrating cycling with a city's transportation ecosystem, significant improvements in air quality can be achieved, leading to healthier and more sustainable urban communities.\n\nNoise Pollution Mitigation\nPollution isn't solely associated with emissions; noise pollution must also be considered a pollutant due to its adverse effects on human health. Excessive noise levels can elevate stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the body, even during sleep. Long-term exposure to these hormones circulating in the bloodstream can lead to life-threatening physiological problems, as highlighted by Alok Jha.\n\nCertain cities now prioritize combatting noise pollution through their sustainability agendas. For example, Vancouver's 2020 action plan, aiming to become \"the world's greenest\" city, envisions a future with cleaner air, reduced machine noise, and an increase in birdsong. While this may sound somewhat idyllic, it showcases how cities are acknowledging the issue of noise pollution. Notably, the same report identifies increased cycling levels as crucial for community development, subtly hinting at the bicycle's role in mitigating noise pollution.\n\nAlthough bicycle networks and bicycles themselves are not a standalone solution \u2013 for urban air quality is influenced by various factors such as weather, geography, and industry \u2013 they undeniably play a significant part. Bicycle-centric cities depend less on energy consumption, emit fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise pollution than cities relying heavily on motorized transportation.\n\nPhoto: lopify. This article is an updated version of a post originally published in November 2011, reflecting the continued relevance of biking as a sustainable urban solution."

      "text": "Promoting Urban Sustainability: Embracing the Bicycle Revolution\n\nAs societies confront a myriad of issues such as sedentary lifestyles, traffic congestion, and isolated city centers, it's essential to reflect on our path and seek transformative change. Having spent three months in Europe last summer, I can testify to the awe-inspiring quality of life in those locations, particularly when compared to the car-centric, lackluster cities of the United States. How did we become so reliant on cars, neglecting alternative modes of transportation like streetcars and bicycles that once thrived in American towns? It is time to draw inspiration from several European cities, notably Amsterdam and Copenhagen, who have successfully integrated the humble bicycle as a key component for restoring transportation balance and promoting sustainability within their urban landscapes.\n\nThe Economic Impact and Health Advantages of Cycling\n\nIn Denmark, universal healthcare funded by taxpayers has been a catalyst for promoting and investing in cycling due to its widely accepted health benefits. Research indicates that adults who commute to work by bicycle experience a 30% reduction in mortality rates. The city of Copenhagen estimates yearly savings of $100 million through reduced healthcare costs, not accounting for the enhanced productivity resulting from a healthier workforce. Additionally, substantial savings are achieved through decreased road maintenance and reduced congestion. Copenhagen invests around $2 million per mile per side in constructing separated bikeways, fully recovering these costs within five years. According to the city's economic impact study, every mile cycled yields a net gain of 21 cents for society, while driving a car incurs a net loss of 12 cents per mile. These figures encompass both public sector savings and increased economic activity in the private sector.\n\nBicycle Commuting: A Pillar of Urban Sustainability\n\nIn greater Copenhagen, more individuals opt for biking as their preferred mode of commuting to work than in the entire United States combined, covering an average distance of 3 \u00bd miles each way. Over the past three decades, the city has gradually reclaimed car parking spaces and road areas, effectively making room for extensive bicycle infrastructure.\n\nThe Netherlands stands out with its pervasive bicycle culture\u2014the most inclusive of any nation globally. The Dutch Cycling Embassy, a public-private organization, capitalizes on the celebrated Dutch model of urban transportation. It actively promotes urban mobility to business and government leaders worldwide who grapple with urbanization, the urgent need for revitalizing cities, and the imperative of sustainable transit solutions. The Dutch possess firsthand experience of how bicycles directly contribute to improved health, livability, road safety, air quality, traffic flow, social connectivity, and economic prosperity.\n\nMarketing the Bicycle: Transforming Transit Perceptions\n\nIn America, establishing the bicycle as a viable form of transportation entails reframing public perception of cyclists as regular citizens rather than segregating them into a subculture. Danish consulting firm Copenhagenize guides cities in fostering positive images of bikes and urban mobility through behavior and marketing campaigns. Their name itself embodies the concept of creating \"complete streets,\" coincidentally shared by an American non-profit organization and movement that has made significant strides in various U.S. cities.\n\nEnhancing Urban Fabric and Revitalizing Downtown Cores\n\nAs our cities cope with diminishing state and federal funding, deserted sidewalks, and dilemmas surrounding accommodating future growth, leaders are actively seeking sustainable development models. Valuable insights can be derived from the thriving tourist hubs of Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Like many cities in the United States, these urban centers face limitations on available land for expansion. However, they have realized that long-term vitality necessitates focusing on existing built-up areas. Today's singles and young families yearn for vibrant urban communities where they can safely walk or bike amidst charming downtowns brimming with shops, entertainment, and urban amenities. By following the urban models of the Dutch and Danes, incorporating comprehensive cycling infrastructure into our cities could unlock the doors to smart growth in America without compromising our ongoing affection for automobiles."

      "text": "Title: The Top 20 Bike-Friendly Cities in the World, Ranked\n\nArticle:\nIn a world where mobility trends come and go, one thing remains constant: the simplicity of design. And when it comes to urban transportation, nothing outshines the timeless efficiency, practicality, and reliability of bicycles. While other alternatives like autonomous cars and dockless pogosticks vie for attention, cities worldwide are recognizing the value of bicycles as everyday modes of transport, making significant infrastructure improvements to enhance urban livability.\n\nTo monitor the progress and pro-cycling initiatives taken by cities globally, we present the Copenhagenize Index \u2013 a comprehensive and holistic ranking system for the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. In its fifth edition since its inception in 2011, the Index evaluates and ranks over 115 cities using 14 parameters that prioritize ambition, culture, and streetscape design. (Learn more about our methodology here.)\n\nAt the top, a closely contested three-horse race unfolds. While Copenhagen retains its throne as the most bike-friendly city, Amsterdam has recently surpassed Utrecht to claim second place with its bold strides forward. All three cities continue to serve as role models for friendly competition below. Moreover, it's not just the Danish and Dutch cities that take cycling seriously anymore. Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux have narrowed the gap in the second pack. Oslo has made remarkable progress over the past four years, ascending in the rankings. Furthermore, newcomers such as Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are showcasing how other cities can create urban spaces that prioritize bicycles. Just beyond the top 20 lies a group of cities on the cusp of breaking through, requiring sustained investments and the implementation of innovative biking solutions to improve their standings in 2021.\n\nFor now, let's dive into the world's 20 most bicycle-friendly cities:\n\n1. Copenhagen\nWith 62 percent of inhabitants travelling to work or school by bike and daily cycling distance reaching 894,000 miles, Copenhagen reigns as a biking paradise. Investing over $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure, the city boasts four newly built or under-construction bicycle bridges and 104 miles of new regional cycle highways. In the 2018 municipal elections, parties advocating for cars were simply unable to compete. However, certain political decisions, including spending limits imposed by the national government, raise concerns for Copenhagen's cycling reputation.\n\n2. Amsterdam\nRebounding in 2019 after slipping to third place previously, Amsterdam showcases how resilience and corrective measures can restore a city's biking prominence. With an ambitious plan for 2022, the Dutch capital aims to enhance bicycle parking and existing infrastructure. Accommodating 11,000 new residents each year, Amsterdam is creating new \"royal routes\" to accommodate the growing number of bikes. To ease rush-hour stress, the city is widening cycle tracks to over eight feet, expanding low-speed cycle streets, and redesigning major intersections to provide protected cycling space. Following through with these plans and implementing them effectively will be crucial for Amsterdam to reclaim the top spot from Copenhagen in 2021.\n\nAs the global trend towards sustainable urban transportation continues to evolve, these top-ranked cities pave the way for others to follow suit. From advanced infrastructure investments to inclusive policies, they prioritize bicycles as indispensable elements of urban mobility. As we look ahead, it is inspiring to witness the efforts and progress made by these cities towards creating greener, healthier, and more bike-centric urban environments."

      "text": "Why are bicycles crucial for creating livable and sustainable cities?\n\nBicycles play a significant role in the planning of sustainable cities, and this topic will be extensively covered during Velo-city 2018. The conference program includes various sessions that delve into urban planning, infrastructure development, and tackling issues like traffic congestion. As we eagerly anticipate the discussions in Rio from June 12th to 15th, let's take a brief look at what it means to plan a sustainable city with a focus on cycling.\n\nBy 2030, cities worldwide will need to accommodate one billion new residents who seek jobs, improved prosperity, and a vibrant social life. However, urban centers cannot continue expanding at their current rate as commuting time cannot exceed an hour. Additionally, we cannot permit millions of new cars to inundate our already polluted cities. Shockingly, air pollution is responsible for a mortality rate five to ten times higher than road accidents. This necessitates a reevaluation of our urban development models, with an emphasis on bolstering public transportation and encouraging active mobility.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that roads are not exclusively meant for cars, as highlighted by former New York Mayor M. Bloomberg in 2012. He initiated a comprehensive sustainable plan for the city, acknowledging the significance of prioritizing cyclists and pedestrians over motorists.\n\nRecognizing the vital role bicycles play in creating more pedestrian-friendly cities, the UN's New World Urban Agenda places cycling and walking above motorized vehicles. To achieve this, it is imperative to invest in cycling and walking infrastructures. Seville serves as a remarkable example in this regard, with The Guardian describing it as a \"poster city for sustainable transport.\" In just a few years, the number of bike trips in Seville increased eleven-fold. Such success stories extend beyond the Netherlands and Denmark, where building sufficient connected and safe lanes can attract a large number of people towards biking.\n\nAnother noteworthy example, albeit unconventional, is Buenos Aires. The city has invested significantly in cycling infrastructure, which resulted in its inclusion in the list of the top 20 most bike-friendly cities. Over 140 km of dedicated cycle paths have been constructed, aiming to enhance the city's appeal while reducing traffic through an improved public transportation system. The ultimate goal is to create a city that is more pleasant to live in where bicycles become a common mode of transport.\n\nDespite these inspiring accomplishments, it is disheartening to observe that car-centric urban infrastructures still receive substantial subsidies; local policies often prioritize parking spaces over cycle paths or pedestrian zones. San Francisco serves as an illustrative case study, wherein a 2010 study revealed that the city provided 441,541 parking spaces, out of which more than half were free on-street spaces. Prioritizing expensive parking spaces not only consumes precious urban areas but also discourages the use of alternative modes of transportation and contributes to increased gas emissions. However, progress is being made around the world, with several cities implementing new parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, recently abolished minimum car parking requirements and established a maximum limit for parking spots within specific projects.\n\nFurthermore, cities with high accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists boast a per capita GDP that is 38% higher compared to cities dominated by heavy traffic. A study conducted by researchers from a university in New Zealand highlights that every dollar spent on building separated bike lanes could potentially save cities up to $24 in reduced healthcare costs and less pollution and traffic. Nevertheless, many investments in cycling infrastructure remain limited and fail to have a substantial positive impact on people's habits and their perception of safety.\n\nIn the upcoming article, we will shift our focus to biking in megacities, exploring the subject of urban sustainability with examples from South America and Europe.\n\n[1] (Source: New York Post)\n[2] (Source: Citiscope.org)\n[3] (Paragraph 114, UN World Urban Agenda)\n[4] (Copenhagenizeindex, 2015)\n[5] (Article - Spanish Only: Ciclosfera.com)\n[6] (Source - Italian Only: Il Sole 24 Ore)"

Influential figures like Brook Boyer view bicycles as more than just a means of urban mobility; they see them as catalysts for progress. Bicycles contribute to sustainable consumption and production, empower girls in rural areas of Africa to attend school, and even support agricultural projects.\nImage: The \"Come on Let's Bike\" initiative aims to bridge the gender gap in bicycling in Syria.\nThe New York Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) works globally to design and implement top-notch transportation systems and policies that create livable, equitable, and sustainable cities. By advocating for comprehensive bike lane networks and adequate bike parking facilities, ITDP has successfully worked with authorities in many cities worldwide. In recent times, ITDP has been instrumental in launching new bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\nWhen it comes to urban planning, current concepts revolve around factors such as user appeal and perceived traffic safety. Planners strive to create forgiving infrastructure that motivates cyclists while ensuring safety. It's essential to encourage everyone, including non-cyclists, to embrace biking as a mode of transportation.\nIn London, investment in \"Cycle Superhighways\" is on the rise. These dedicated cycle routes provide faster, safer, and more direct access to central London from outer regions. Former London Mayor, Boris Johnson, stated in 2014 during the official opening of the first superhighways, \"Getting more people on their bikes will reduce pressure on the road, bus, and rail networks, cut pollution, and improve life for everyone, whether they cycle themselves or not.\" Johnson's successor, Sadiq Khan, pledged \u00a3770m to cycling initiatives during his tenure, underscoring the commitment to a greener and healthier London. The implementation of cycle paths, segregated from other traffic, has already resulted in a noticeable decrease in car congestion.\nMelbourne's Bicycle Plan for 2016-2020, titled \"A Connected City,\" prioritizes safe cycling in urban planning. The plan emphasizes creating a functional network that enables residents of all ages to access services and opportunities offered by the municipality. Safety and reduced traffic congestion are key objectives in turning Melbourne into a cleaner and more livable city.\nLocated in southeast China, Xiamen boasts the world's longest cycle path, stretching 7.6 km. Built beneath the city's existing bus transportation system, this skyway connects major residential and business districts. With parking spaces for over 2000 bikes and links to 11 bus stations and two subway stations, cycling in Xiamen has become highly convenient. Danish architecture studio DISSING+WEITLING, known for their innovative work in Copenhagen, was behind this bridge project, taking inspiration from their successful Cycle Superhighways and The Bicycle Snake.\nIn the Netherlands, Eindhoven showcases futuristic cycling elements with landmarks like the Hovenring bicycle bridge and the Van Gogh Path. These architectural marvels elevate the cycling experience, allowing riders to traverse elevated paths or admire artistic illuminations based on Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece \"The Starry Night.\"\nBicycle manufacturers continuously respond to the demand for urban cycling with innovative product offerings. From e-bikes and cargo bikes to folding bikes and belt-drive bikes, every segment receives attention to cater to private, commercial, and municipal users.\nBrian Hohl, an industrial designer from DIAVELO - Protanium B.V (Accell Group), highlights the integration of light and compact lithium batteries into electric bicycles. Their design philosophy revolves around creating inviting and user-friendly electric bikes that accommodate everyone's needs. Protanium has actively invested its expertise in the EBIKE4DELIVERY project, which focuses on making meal deliveries across Europe both greener and healthier. Another emerging trend involves the use of heavy-duty cargo bikes for package delivery, reducing the need for motorized vehicles and alleviating road congestion.\nMajor parcel service providers in Germany, including DHL, dpd, GLS, Hermes, and UPS, have established a collectively used transshipment point consisting of twelve cargo bikes. These cargo bikes operate within a three to five-kilometer radius, replacing traditional delivery vehicles and minimizing traffic obstruction. This initiative demonstrates how cargo bikes can play a pivotal role in maintaining efficient urban logistics.\nChina and Taiwan dominate the global bicycle market, accounting for approximately 90% of global production. Europe alone witnesses the sale of nearly 30 million bicycles and EPACs (Electric Power-Assisted Cycles) annually, with around 13 million units produced within the EU.\nWhile bicycles were once the primary mode of transportation in China, the rapid increase in car ownership has shifted the dynamics. However, this dependence on cars poses significant challenges for Chinese urban centers. To mitigate this, many Chinese cities are embracing bike-sharing programs to encourage alternative means of transportation. Asian providers such as Mobike, Obike, Ofo, and Yobike are giving competition to companies like Call-a-bike (Deutsche Bahn), Jump Bikes, Nice Ride, and Nextbike. As the bike-sharing trend grows in Europe and the USA, smart cities are exploring last-mile solutions, expanding beyond bicycles and e-bikes to include e-scooters and semi-automated shuttle buses.\nIt is worth noting that the profitability of bike-sharing services remains a challenge, leading to concerns regarding the potential targeting of user data.

      "text": "Title:\nAssessing Bike-Friendly Cities in the United States Through a Sustainability Indicator\n\nArticle:\nMeasuring the bike friendliness of cities has become increasingly crucial in promoting sustainable transportation options across the United States. As a resident of Brooklyn, I am well aware of the time efficiency and convenience that biking provides within the borough compared to other modes of transport like the subway. However, it is essential to consider how cities plan for bicyclists and prioritize the development of cycling infrastructure.\n\nTransportation choices have significant implications, not only on individual mobility but also on broader aspects such as carbon dioxide emissions and public health. Transportation contributes to nearly one-quarter of global CO2 emissions, making it necessary to explore alternative options like biking. Additionally, pollution exposure and insufficient physical activity associated with sedentary lifestyles contribute to numerous health issues, including obesity and its related complications.\n\nTo delve into bicycle commuting trends across the 35 largest cities in the U.S., I embarked on an investigation, focusing on the efforts made by these cities to facilitate efficient and safe cycling experiences. In my research, I found substantial value in sustainability indicators, which effectively evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of a city's sustainability. These indicators, when compiled, form aggregate indexes that help policymakers, educators, and interested individuals interpret and assess different cities' bike-friendly environments.\n\nCollecting and analyzing data from various sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists, allowed me to create a comprehensive index. Unlike most existing rankings, my index accounts not only for factors such as social infrastructure and bicycle education programs but also considers environmental health factors, particularly air quality. Addressing air pollution as part of improving bicycle infrastructure is crucial for ensuring long-term sustainability and fostering resilient communities.\n\nWhile developing the index, I incorporated indicators like the presence of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of employees dedicated to bicycle-related issues, and a city's average exposure levels to harmful air pollutants. I also took into account city infrastructure and safety by evaluating the miles of bicycle infrastructure relative to the city's size, the availability of bicycles through bike-sharing programs, and fatality rates among cyclists. It is important to note that sustainability indices focus on areas where cities can directly make improvements.\n\nThe results of the index shed light on the varying bike friendliness among the largest U.S. cities. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver emerged as highly bike-friendly cities, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City ranked lower in terms of their bike-friendliness.\n\nFurthermore, the index highlights correlations between different indicators. Notably, there is a negative correlation between the rate of individuals biking to work and the rate of bicyclist fatalities. This finding suggests that cities with higher rates of bike commuting tend to have lower cyclist fatality rates and vice versa. Such insights can provide persuasive arguments to policymakers in advocating for improved cycling infrastructure and encouraging higher numbers of bike commuters.\n\nAs we face the challenges of climate change, sustainability indicators offer valuable perspectives on our relationship with the environment, both built and natural. By utilizing these indices to enhance accessibility to alternative transportation methods, cities can actively promote cycling and contribute to changing the patterns of climate change. A resilient future lies in envisioning sustainable transportation systems and adopting measures that support them.\n\nThis article was originally published on the Earth Institute, Columbia University blog (http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu) and is republished here with permission."

      "text": "Why Bicycling is Essential for Building Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nBicycles have long been hailed as an integral part of creating more environmentally sustainable cities. Their energy efficiency and positive impact on urban environments make them a promising solution. In this article, we will delve into the benefits of cycling and bike networks, highlighting their crucial role in developing sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nCompared to other modes of transportation, bicycles require minimal energy to produce. Data from the United States in 2008 reveals that a road bicycle weighing 7.2kg with a carbon frame only consumes 11,546,658,000 Joules during manufacturing, whereas a generic car uses a staggering 118,284,466,000 Joules (Figures via WattzOn). Even when considering variations based on different types of bikes and external factors, bicycles exhibit significantly lower embodied energy.\n\nMoreover, constructing bicycle lanes demands less energy compared to building roads for automobiles. Bicycle infrastructure requires lesser space, reduced foundation materials, and lower-energy maintenance procedures.\n\nAir Quality Improvement\nThe environmental advantages of bicycles go beyond energy efficiency. Switching from polluting modes of transportation to bicycles, which produce zero emissions when in use, helps reduce carbon emissions and enhance air quality in cities. If a substantial number of people make this switch, the benefits will become tangible for a city's residents.\n\nFor individuals who transition from driving cars to riding bikes, both their personal carbon footprint and carbon emissions decrease. When cycling becomes a compelling alternative to other means of transport (as it already is in some cities), achieving a modal shift towards cycling becomes more attainable. A well-developed bicycle network plays a vital role in facilitating this change and can contribute to improving air quality.\n\nNoise Pollution Reduction\nPollution is not limited to emissions alone; noise pollution also poses health risks and affects urban dwellers' well-being. Noise levels in cities can increase stress hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, even during sleep. Prolonged exposure to these hormones can lead to severe physiological problems.\nCertain cities are prioritizing noise pollution reduction as part of their sustainability initiatives. Vancouver's 2020 action plan, aiming to become the \"world's greenest\" city, envisions a future with \"less pollution and cleaner air, less machine noise and more birdsong.\"\n\nWhile these sustainability goals may seem idealistic, they highlight the growing recognition of noise pollution as an issue. The same report emphasizes the significance of increased cycling levels in developing communities, subtly acknowledging the role of bicycles in reducing noise pollution.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that bicycle networks and bicycles alone cannot provide all the answers to urban challenges. Analyzing urban air quality is a complex process influenced by factors such as weather, geography, and industry, which bike networks cannot control. Furthermore, each city faces unique circumstances. Nonetheless, cities that prioritize bicycles over automated transport options will consume less energy, emit fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise.\n\nPhoto by lopify.

      "text": "Urban Sustainability and the Revolutionary Bicycle\n\nIn our quest to address prevalent challenges such as obesity, traffic congestion, diminishing family time, and the isolation of city centers, it is important to reflect on how we arrived at this juncture and explore potential solutions. Having spent three months in Europe last summer, I can attest to the awe-inspiring quality of life in these regions compared to the car-dependent, monotonous American cities. The decline of streetcars and bicycles, once vital modes of transportation in American towns, throughout the 1930s played a significant role in shaping our predominantly car-centric society today. However, European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen have emerged as exemplars by embracing the humble bicycle as a powerful catalyst for reclaiming transportation equilibrium and fostering urban sustainability.\n\nThe Economic Impact of Bicycles and Health Dividends\n\nDenmark's tax-funded universal healthcare system has not only stimulated investment in bicycle infrastructure but also recognized the well-established health benefits associated with cycling. Studies reveal that adults who commute to work by bicycle demonstrate a striking 30% decrease in mortality rates. In Copenhagen alone, around $100 million is saved each year in healthcare costs. Moreover, these savings don't even account for the enhanced workforce productivity, reduced road maintenance requirements, and alleviated congestion. Interestingly, building separate cycling lanes in Copenhagen costs approximately $2 million per mile per side, a figure recovered within just five years. Astonishingly, the city's economic impact assessment estimates that every mile cycled yields a net societal gain of 21 cents, compared to a net loss of 12 cents per mile driven by cars. These calculations encompass both public sector savings and the surge in private sector economic activity.\n\nBicycle Commuting: A Catalyst for Urban Sustainability\n\nPresently, more Copenhagen residents bike to work than the entire inhabitants of the United States combined, averaging about 3 \u00bd miles per trip. Over the past three decades, the city has progressively reallocated car parking and road space to create a seamless environment for cyclists.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands boasts a cycling culture unparalleled in any other country. The Dutch Cycling Embassy, a public-private organization, capitalizes on their renowned urban transport model. It actively promotes urban mobility to leaders from around the world, emphasizing the importance of revitalizing cities, sustaining transit solutions, promoting healthier lifestyles, enhancing road safety, preserving clean air, optimizing traffic flow, mitigating social isolation, and strengthening the economy.\n\nPromoting Bicycles as a Viable Transit Option\n\nWithin the United States, successfully integrating bicycles into our transit infrastructure necessitates repositioning bicyclists as regular citizens rather than an exclusive subculture. Denmark's consultancy firm, Copenhagenize, provides valuable guidance to cities seeking to cultivate positive perceptions of bikes and urban mobility through behavioral and marketing campaigns. Their name itself encompasses the concept of developing \"complete streets,\" which coincidentally mirrors the goals of the American non-profit organization and movement, Complete Streets, that has made substantial progress in numerous U.S. cities.\n\nEnhancing Urban Flourish and Embracing Downtown Vitality\n\nAs our cities confront declining state and federal funding, vacant sidewalks, and dilemmas regarding accommodating future growth, leaders are exploring sustainable development models. Inspired by the thriving tourist hubs in Amsterdam and Copenhagen, many American cities are recognizing the value of concentrating growth within existing built-up areas instead of sprawling outward. Modern singles and young families yearn for vibrant town experiences where they can safely walk or cycle through downtowns adorned with shops, entertainment options, and urban amenities. By incorporating extensive and well-designed cycling infrastructure similar to the Dutch and Danish models, America can unlock the potential of smart-growth without compromising our enduring love affair with automobiles."

      "text": "Why are bicycles vital for creating livable and sustainable cities?\n\nBicycles play a crucial role in the planning of sustainable cities. This topic will be extensively discussed at Velo-city 2018, a conference dedicated to urban development, infrastructure, and traffic congestion. As we eagerly anticipate the discussions in Rio from June 12th to 15th, let's briefly delve into what it means to plan a sustainable city from a cycling perspective.\n\nBy 2030, cities worldwide will need to accommodate an additional billion residents seeking employment, prosperity, and social engagement. However, existing urban centers cannot continue to expand at their current rate. The maximum limit for urban commuting should not exceed one hour. We must also avoid adding millions of new cars to our already heavily-polluted urban areas. In fact, air pollution causes a mortality rate that is five to ten times higher than road accidents. To address these issues, we must reconsider our current models of urban development and prioritize public transport and active mobility.\n\nIt is vital to recognize that roads should not solely cater to cars. In 2012, former New York Mayor M. Bloomberg emphasized the importance of cyclists and pedestrians over motorists. This viewpoint was further reinforced by the United Nations' New World Urban Agenda, which gives priority to cycling and walking over motorized vehicles. To achieve this goal, investing in cycling and walking infrastructures becomes essential. A notable example of successful implementation can be seen in Seville, where the number of bike trips multiplied eleven-fold within a few years. While traditional cycling powerhouses like the Netherlands and Denmark have achieved remarkable outcomes, Seville showcases that any urban area can encourage cycling by simply building safe, interconnected lanes.\n\nBuenos Aires provides another intriguing case study. By investing significantly in cycling infrastructure, the city has earned a place among the top twenty most bike-friendly cities. Constructing more than 140 kilometers of cycle paths has made Buenos Aires more attractive while reducing traffic congestion through the development of an efficient public transport system. This transformation aims to create a more livable city where bicycling becomes a common mode of transportation.\n\nDespite these success stories, car-centric urban infrastructures often receive more subsidies than cycle paths or pedestrian zones under local policies. For instance, San Francisco had 441,541 parking spaces, with over half of them being free on-street spots according to a 2010 study. By minimizing the availability of costly parking spaces, cities can reclaim urban areas and incentivize people to embrace alternative modes of transportation, thereby reducing gas emissions. Although there is still much progress to be made, several cities worldwide have implemented new parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, abolished minimum car parking requirements while setting a maximum limit on the number of parking spots permitted in specific projects.\n\nFurthermore, cities with high levels of pedestrian and cycling accessibility enjoy 38% higher GDP per capita compared to those dominated by traffic. Researchers from the University of New Zealand also found that for every dollar spent on new separated bike lanes, cities could save up to $24 due to lower healthcare costs, reduced pollution, and less traffic congestion. However, investments in cycling infrastructure often remain inadequate and limited, failing to have a significant positive impact on people's habits and their perception of safety.\n\nIn the next article, we will focus on cycling in megacities, exploring urban sustainability with examples from South America and Europe.\n\n[1] Read more at: https://nypost.com/2012/10/26/bloomberg-says-mass-transit-cyclists-more-important-than-drivers-who-clog-roads/\n[2] Find out more here: http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/commentary/2016/10/cycling-can-help-new-urban-agendas-aims-more-youd-think\n[3] UN World Urban Agenda, Paragraph 114 states, \"a significant increase in accessible safe, efficient, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure for public transport as well as non-motorized options such as walking and cycling, prioritizing them over private motorized transportation.\"\n[4] Copenhagenizeindex, 2015 http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/#\n[5] Spanish article available at (only in Spanish) http://www.ciclosfera.com/copenhagenize-buenos-aires-la-mejor-ciudad-de-latinoamerica-para-ir-en-bici/\n[6] Italian article available at (only in Italian), http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-07-20/ridisegnare-citta-misura-d-uomo-081253.shtml?refresh_ce=1"

      "text": "Introducing a Bike-Friendly Cities Sustainability Indicator for the U.S.\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, I am constantly amazed by the efficiency and convenience of biking as a means of transportation within the borough. Compared to the subway system, which primarily connects to Manhattan, biking offers a more effective way to navigate through the other boroughs. Whether we personally ride bicycles, know someone who does, or simply have thoughts about cyclists on the road, it's worth considering how cities prioritize biking infrastructure.\n\nOur individual transportation choices are influenced by the larger context of transportation infrastructure, which determines the accessibility and ease of using roads, bike lanes, or subway routes. These decisions hold significant importance, as transport accounts for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, impacting both the environment and public health due to pollution exposure and lack of physical activity. The World Health Organization reports that physical inactivity, overweight conditions, and obesity contribute to 11 percent of annual worldwide deaths.\n\nCurious about bicycle commuting and city planning, I recently delved into an exploration of how U.S. cities facilitate and encourage biking as a mode of transport. Attending a sustainability indicators class led by Alex de Sherbinin, an exceptional environmental data analyst and associate director for science applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia, provided valuable insights.\n\nThe course focused on sustainability indicators, a way to measure the sustainability of social, economic, and environmental systems. By combining various indicators, we can create aggregate indexes or indices that offer concise conclusions more easily interpreted by educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and curious individuals worldwide. Enhancing urban infrastructure and resilience against environmental and social challenges is heavily reliant on opportunities for experience-sharing among decision makers.\n\nMotivated to develop an index that considers the interconnectedness of socioeconomics and the environment, I discovered that while existing rankings assess the bike-friendliness of U.S. cities, many neglect to include environmental health factors. Addressing air pollution and public health indicators should be integral to fostering sustainability with a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. This kind of 'systems thinking' not only aids understanding of environmental health and vulnerability but also bolsters community resilience.\n\nMy index gives due consideration to social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To support this holistic perspective, I incorporated factors like the presence of youth and adult bicycle education initiatives, the number of dedicated full-time employees working on bicycle-related issues in a city, and average levels of exposure to three major air pollutants. Additionally, my index evaluates city infrastructure and safety by looking at the extent of bicycle infrastructure (bike lanes, routes, pathways) relative to the city's size, the availability of shared bicycles per capita, and bicyclist fatality rates. Notably, sustainability indexes exclude factors beyond a city's direct control, such as hilly terrain or extreme temperatures.\n\nConstructing the index involved gathering data from valuable sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists. To ensure its relevance, significance, and importance, I sought input from experts within and outside the academic community. After performing statistical analyses and computations to eliminate bias and standardize the data, the final step entailed consolidating all the indicators into a comprehensive index through normalization and weighting.\n\nThe resulting data allows us to rank the largest U.S. cities based on their bike-friendliness, taking into account various factors. Cities like San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), Washington, D.C., and Denver ranked highly, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City fared lowest in the rankings.\n\nMoreover, analyzing the index reveals patterns and correlations between different indicators. One notable implication is the negative correlation between the rate of individuals biking to work and the rate of bicyclist fatalities. This insight provides a compelling argument for policymakers to advocate for improved infrastructure that encourages cycling and subsequently reduces cyclist deaths.\n\nAs climate change influences our environment, it also reshapes our perspectives. Sustainability indicators offer a fresh lens through which we can view our relationship with the built and natural environment. Leveraging these indicators can help us envision and work towards a more resilient future. Our visions of the future determine our actions and ultimately shape the trajectory of climate change. Thus, employing sustainability indices to enhance alternate transportation options and promote cycling can play a pivotal role in altering our climate cycles.\n\nThis article was republished with permission from Earth Institute, Columbia University.

      "text": "Title: Promoting Sustainable Transportation Through Biking\n\nArticle:\nInsights & Recommendations\nCan cycling help combat global warming? Absolutely! When more individuals embrace cycling as a means of sustainable transportation, it can have a significant impact.\nThe Environmental Impact of Transportation\nTransportation is accountable for roughly 25% of global carbon emissions. Shockingly, 80% of city dwellers choose high-emission motor vehicles for their personal commuting needs.\nHowever, the majority of trips are less than 10km in distance, which is easily achievable by bike. Whether it's reaching your destination directly or connecting to public transportation, opting for cycling is an excellent choice. To facilitate this, secure bike parking areas like Parkiteer can provide peace of mind.\nAccording to research from the University of California, Davis' Institute for Transport Studies, if bicycles and electric bikes were utilized for 22% of all transportation trips worldwide, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption could be reduced by 47% by 2050.\nCycling is also space-efficient, allowing for more green spaces and the preservation of heat-absorbing and water-permeable surfaces.\n\nCommute Sustainably\nYou can immediately start reducing your ecological footprint by swapping it with a bicycle tire print for your transportation needs.\nRiding 10km each way to work, as estimated in a report by the Queensland Government, would save around 1,500kg of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Additionally, it could alleviate the current congestion caused by motor vehicles, which contribute approximately 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gases across Australia's major cities.\nTo promote cycling as a viable mode of commuting, programs such as Ride2Work offer comprehensive support and resources. The Ride2Work website provides crucial information to begin your cycling commute and inspire others to do the same.\nFor local journeys to places like schools, shops, pools, or gyms, bicycling is an ideal option. Equip yourself with a basket or panniers to effortlessly transport your belongings on your bike.\nIf you're interested in promoting cycling in schools, the Ride2School program offers valuable resources. Visit the Ride2School website to access materials that can assist your family and foster a cycling culture within your school community.\nExperiencing the satisfaction of sustainable transportation is something only cyclists truly understand\u2014a hidden secret of happiness.\n\nBuilding Sustainable Cities\nGovernment intervention is essential in developing comprehensive networks of bike lanes and paths to encourage more individuals to cycle. Local authorities are leading the charge towards sustainable transportation solutions.\nThe Compact of Mayors, a global coalition committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advocating for climate action, includes two Australian metropolitan mayors\u2014Clover Moore of Sydney and Robert Doyle of Melbourne. According to The Guardian, this international coalition of cities is playing a proactive role in addressing climate change.\nCities like Melbourne are taking concrete measures to ensure diversity of access to the central business district. With both a Walking Plan and a Bicycle Plan in place, Melbourne aims to improve alternative transportation options. The city has even introduced a Last Kilometre Freight Plan to replace motor vehicle deliveries with more sustainable methods such as bicycle couriers.\nAt the national level, leaders are recognizing the importance of creating livable cities. The establishment of a Ministry for Cities in 2015 by the Turnbull Coalition Government, alongside the opposition's Shadow Ministry for Cities, Infrastructure, and Transport, showcases bipartisan commitment.\nBicycle Network advocates for more robust leadership, with Greens Senator Janet Rice emphasizing the need to prioritize walking, cycling, and public transport. They urge the federal government to establish Australia's first national bicycle infrastructure fund, unlocking the extensive health, economic, and livability benefits associated with bike-friendly cities."

      "text": "Why Bicycling is Essential for Creating Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nBicycles have long been hailed as a powerful force in promoting energy efficiency and the transition towards environmentally sustainable cities. But why exactly are bicycles beneficial, and how do they contribute to the development of such cities? Furthermore, what is the environmental impact of the infrastructure required to support cycling in urban areas? In this article, we will explore three key benefits of cycling and bicycle networks, highlighting their positive role in creating environmentally sustainable cities while incorporating fresh vocabulary and knowledge from the domain of biking.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nIn terms of energy consumption, bicycles outshine other modes of transportation by a significant margin. Back in 2008, data from the United States revealed that the production of a 7.2kg road bicycle with a carbon frame consumed a mere 11,546,658,000 joules of energy, compared to a staggering 118,284,466,000 joules for a typical car (Figures sourced from WattzOn). It's important to note that these numbers may vary slightly based on factors like bicycle type and external conditions, but regardless, bicycles possess substantially lower embodied energy.\n\nFurthermore, constructing bicycle lanes requires less energy than building roads for automobiles. These lanes occupy less space, necessitate reduced foundations and materials, and demand less energy-intensive maintenance, making them an eco-friendly choice for fostering biking in cities.\n\nAir Quality Improvement\nThe environmental sustainability of bicycles extends beyond their lower energy requirements. Whenever someone switches from a private vehicle, which usually contributes to pollution, to a bicycle\u2014a zero-emission mode of transport\u2014the city experiences reduced carbon emissions and an enhancement in air quality. When a substantial number of people opt for cycling, the positive effects become more tangible for urban residents.\n\nEvery individual who opts for biking over driving reduces their personal carbon footprint and lowers carbon emissions. If cycling becomes an appealing and realistic alternative to other forms of transportation, as it already has in some cities, achieving a modal shift towards bicycles would be more attainable. An improved bicycle network plays a crucial role in this endeavor, along with catering to a city's other cycling needs, ultimately leading to improved air quality becoming a reality.\n\nNoise Pollution\nPollution isn't limited to emissions alone; noise levels within cities can also be regarded as pollutants, posing long-term health risks. Excessive noise triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, even during periods of rest. Prolonged circulation of these hormones in the bloodstream can contribute to life-threatening physiological problems (Alok Jha).\n\nSome cities, such as Vancouver, have even included noise pollution reduction as part of their sustainability agenda. Vancouver's 2020 action plan envisions a highly sustainable future for the Canadian city, aiming for \"less pollution and cleaner air, less machine noise and more birdsong.\" Although at times it may sound like a storybook tale of sustainability, the inclusion of noise pollution reduction in the agenda demonstrates its consideration, at least in certain cities. The same report cites an increase in cycling levels as pivotal to community development, subtly hinting at the bicycle's potential in reducing noise pollution.\n\nDespite these obvious advantages for urban environments, it's important to note that bicycle networks and bicycles themselves aren't the sole solution\u2014such simplicity would be too idealistic! Assessing urban air quality is a complex task influenced by various factors such as weather, geography, and industry\u2014variables beyond the control of bicycle networks that differ from city to city. Additionally, cities will always consume energy, emit carbon, and generate noise to some extent. Nevertheless, a city that prioritizes bicycles over automated transportation options will require less energy, produce fewer carbon emissions, and generate less noise.\n\nPhoto: lopify.

      "text": "The role of bicycles in urban sustainability is a topic that deserves attention. In the United States, various societal issues such as obesity, traffic congestion, and social isolation have become widespread. However, by examining successful examples from Europe, particularly cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, we can gain insight into how bicycles can be a crucial tool in revitalizing our urban centers and achieving transportation balance and sustainability.\n\nOne significant factor that has contributed to the dependence on cars in American society is the neglect of alternative modes of transportation, such as streetcars and bicycles. In contrast, European cities have prioritized these modes, leading to improved quality of life. By embracing bicycles, we can address multiple challenges simultaneously.\n\nDenmark serves as an exemplary case in terms of economic impact and health benefits derived from biking. The country's investment in bike usage, fueled by tax-funded universal health care, has resulted in substantial health improvements among its citizens. Studies indicate a remarkable 30% reduction in mortality rates among adults who commute by bicycle. Furthermore, Copenhagen, for instance, saves approximately $100 million annually in healthcare costs alone, with additional benefits stemming from increased productivity and reduced road maintenance and congestion.\n\nBicycle commuting plays a significant role in promoting urban sustainability. In Copenhagen, more people choose to bike to work compared to the entire United States. The city has achieved this through a gradual removal of car-parking spaces and road modifications to accommodate bike infrastructure, providing a safe and efficient cycling environment.\n\nThe Netherlands takes pride in its inclusive culture of biking and serves as a global example with organizations like the Dutch Cycling Embassy promoting their successful urban transportation model. This model emphasizes the positive impact of bicycles on health, urban livability, road safety, air quality, traffic flow, social engagement, and the economy. It offers valuable insights for other countries facing urbanization, the need for city revitalization, and sustainable transit solutions.\n\nTo establish bicycles as a viable form of transit in the United States, we must reframe the perception of cyclists as regular citizens rather than a subculture. Consulting firms like Copenhagenize provide guidance to cities on behavior and marketing campaigns that boost the image of biking and urban mobility. Their principles align with those of the \"complete streets\" movement, which aims to create livable cities through comprehensive street design, emphasizing the accessibility and safety of all road users.\n\nAs our cities grapple with funding shortages and search for ways to accommodate growth, they can draw inspiration from cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. These tourist hotspots, with limited land availability for expansion, provide meaningful urban experiences where walking or biking through vibrant downtown areas filled with shops, entertainment, and amenities is highly desirable. By incorporating extensive bike infrastructures, similar to the Dutch and Danish models, cities can encourage a significant portion of their population to embrace biking as a routine mode of transportation. Promoting smart growth based on these principles allows us to strike a balance between urban vitality and our ongoing interest in cars.\n\nIn conclusion, leveraging bicycles as a means of urban transportation presents opportunities for addressing societal challenges and fostering sustainability. Following Europe's successful models, integrating bikes into our cities will not only improve health outcomes and reduce congestion but also promote community engagement and enhance the overall urban fabric. By investing in bike-friendly infrastructure and changing perceptions around cycling, we can pave the way for a greener and more vibrant future."

      "text": "Title: The Top 20 Bike-Friendly Cities in the World, Ranked\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of urban mobility, where new trends emerge and fade, one mode of transportation continues to stand the test of time: the bicycle. With its efficiency, practicality, and reliability, it remains the go-to solution for cities seeking sustainable urban mobility. Recognizing this, many cities worldwide are actively working on building infrastructure and expanding facilities to make biking a primary mode of transportation while enhancing the overall livability of urban areas.\nHowever, some cities are leading the pack in terms of their pro-cycling efforts. To keep track of these initiatives, the Copenhagenize Index, a comprehensive ranking of the world's most bike-friendly cities, has been established. This biennially published index evaluates over 115 cities from around the globe based on 14 parameters that focus on ambition, culture, and streetscape design. Now in its fifth edition since its inception in 2011, the index provides valuable insights into which cities are truly embracing biking as an integral part of their urban fabric. \nAt the top of the list, a three-way competition rages on. While Copenhagen continues to hold the coveted first place, Amsterdam has made impressive strides, displacing Utrecht and securing the second spot with recent bold initiatives. These cities serve as role models for others, demonstrating the potential for friendly competition in promoting biking culture. However, it is worth noting that beyond Denmark and the Netherlands, more cities are now recognizing the significance of bicycles in their urban landscapes. The second tier of cities, including Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux, are catching up swiftly. Oslo has significantly improved its ranking over the past four years, and newcomers like Bogot\u00e1, Bremen, Taipei, and Vancouver are setting an example for other urban centers to follow suit and become more bike-friendly. Meanwhile, several cities hovering just outside the top 20 are on the verge of breaking through and can enhance their rankings with sustained investment and implementation of innovative biking solutions.\nWith anticipation for future rankings, let us explore the current top 20 world's most bicycle-friendly cities.\nHere's a closer look at two exemplary cities on the list:\nCopenhagen: With 62 percent of inhabitants choosing bikes for their journeys to work or school, Copenhagen certainly leads the pack. Its residents collectively cycle an impressive 894,000 miles every day. Notably, the city invests over $45 per capita in developing robust bicycle infrastructure. Copenhagen boasts the construction of four new bicycle bridges and continues to expand its regional cycle highways, adding approximately 104 miles to the existing network. Additionally, recent municipal elections have exhibited the public's inclination towards pro-cycling parties, firmly establishing biking as a priority. Despite these achievements, however, there are some concerns about the city's cycling reputation due to imposed spending limits by the national government, which might hinder further infrastructural expansion. To maintain its global inspiration status, Copenhagen needs to find effective ways to overcome these challenges.\nAmsterdam: Regaining its stride in 2019, Amsterdam swiftly elevated itself after dropping to third place in the previous rankings. The Dutch capital exemplifies how a city, recognizing signs of decline, can bounce back stronger than before. Amsterdam recently unveiled an ambitious plan for 2022 that focuses on improving bicycle parking and existing infrastructure. The city's growing population, with 11,000 new inhabitants each year, necessitates proactive measures to accommodate more cyclists. As part of this plan, Amsterdam intends to widen cycle tracks to over eight feet, build additional low-speed cycle streets, and redesign major intersections to prioritize cyclist safety. By implementing these initiatives, the city aims to reduce congestion during peak hours and create more protected spaces for bikers. The challenge lies in ensuring that the envisioned plans become a reality. Through the provision of additional bike connections, expanded facilities, improved wayfinding systems, and stricter enforcement against mopeds on cycle tracks, Amsterdam aspires to reclaim its ranking in 2021, dethroning Copenhagen and reaffirming its position as a premier bike-friendly city.\nAs we await the next edition of the Copenhagenize Index, these cities continue to serve as inspirations for others seeking to embrace the true potential of biking in urban environments. Their commitment to fostering a vibrant biking culture demonstrates the positive impact bicycles can have on the livability and sustainability of cities."

      "text": "Why are bicycles crucial for creating livable and sustainable cities?\n\nCycling plays a fundamental role in the planning of sustainable cities. Velo-city 2018, a conference dedicated to biking initiatives, is set to delve into this topic in great detail. The program will encompass various sessions that focus on urban planning, infrastructure development, and issues related to urban growth and traffic congestion. As we anticipate the discussions at the event taking place in Rio from June 12th to 15th, let's briefly analyze what planning a sustainable city means from a cycling standpoint.\n\nOver the next decade, cities worldwide will witness an influx of one billion new residents seeking better job opportunities, increased wealth, and a more vibrant social life. However, it is not feasible for urban centers to continue expanding at the current rate. Commuting within a city should ideally be limited to one hour. Furthermore, introducing millions of new cars to already heavily polluted urban areas is not a viable option. Air pollution currently results in a mortality rate that is between five and ten times higher than that caused by road accidents. Consequently, it is imperative to reconsider our present urban development models and prioritize investments in public transportation and active mobility.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that roads are not solely designed for cars. In fact, former New York mayor M. Bloomberg stated back in 2012 that cyclists and pedestrians hold greater significance than motorists. This sentiment aligns with the United Nations' New World Urban Agenda, which explicitly prioritizes cycling and walking over motorized forms of transportation. To achieve this goal, investing in cycling and walking infrastructures becomes paramount. A shining example in this regard is the city of Seville, highlighted in an insightful article by The Guardian as a \"poster city for sustainable transport.\" Within a few years, the number of bicycle trips in Seville multiplied eleven-fold. Such achievements inspire confidence that almost any urban area can attract a significant number of cyclists by simply constructing sufficient interconnected, safe lanes for them.\n\nAnother noteworthy example is Buenos Aires, a city that has made considerable investments in cycling infrastructure. As a result, it now ranks among the top 20 bike-friendly cities globally. Over 140 kilometers of new cycle paths have been built in Buenos Aires, aimed at making the city more attractive and reducing traffic congestion through the development of efficient public transport systems. The ultimate objective is to foster a livable city where bicycles become a widely adopted mode of transportation.\n\nDespite these success stories, there remains a persistent issue: traditional urban policies tend to heavily subsidize car-related infrastructures. For instance, consider the case of San Francisco, where a study conducted in 2010 found that the city had a staggering 441,541 parking spaces, with over half of them being free, on-street spots. Reducing the allocation of costly parking spaces not only reclaims urban spaces but also promotes alternative modes of transportation while curbing emissions. Thankfully, progress is being made worldwide, and many cities have implemented new parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, recently enacted legislation that abolished minimum car parking requirements and introduced constraints on the number of parking spots allowed in specific projects.\n\nMoreover, cities characterized by high accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists also boast GDP per capita levels 38% higher than cities dominated by vehicular traffic. Exciting research from New Zealand University supports this claim, revealing that for every dollar spent on building new separated bike lanes, cities could save up to $24 due to reduced healthcare costs, improved air quality, and less traffic congestion. Nevertheless, investments often fall short, failing to create a significant impact on people's habits and their perception of safety.\n\nThe next article will explore cycling in megacities, revisiting the subject of urban sustainability while examining case studies from South America and Europe.\n\n[1] Source: https://nypost.com/2012/10/26/bloomberg-says-mass-transit-cyclists-more-important-than-drivers-who-clog-roads/\n[2] For further reading, visit http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/commentary/2016/10/cycling-can-help-new-urban-agendas-aims-more-youd-think\n[3] Paragraph 114, UN World Urban Agenda: \"a significant increase in accessible safe, efficient, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure for public transport as well as non-motorized options such as walking and cycling, prioritizing them over private motorized transportation.\"\n[4] Copenhagenizeindex, 2015 http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/#\n[5] Read the article (only in Spanish) at http://www.ciclosfera.com/copenhagenize-buenos-aires-la-mejor-ciudad-de-latinoamerica-para-ir-en-bici/\n[6] Check this link (only in Italian), http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-07-20/ridisegnare-citta-misura-d-uomo-081253.shtml?refresh_ce=1\nContact the author\nRecent news!\nContact Us\nAvenue des Arts, 7-8\nPostal address: Rue de la Charit\u00e9, 22\n1210 Brussels, Belgium"

Enroll for an acknowledgment.\nIncompatible browser detected\nYour browser is outdated. Upgrade it to enhance your browsing experience.\n\"An urbanite and eco-friendly city equals a bicycle-friendly city\" - this equation often serves as the foundation for urban planning, developed by architects and planners to create cities that offer an improved quality of life.\n\nNotably, cities like London and Melbourne have made substantial investments in bicycle networks as efficient commuting and transportation routes. Recognizing the need to alleviate traffic congestion, bike manufacturers are capitalizing on the rising trend of urban cycling. As a result, brightly colored bikes from bike-sharing programs have become a common sight on city streets.\n\nCargo bikes have also gained popularity among families due to their ability to carry heavy loads, thanks to strong electric motors. This feature has also made cargo bikes appealing to municipal and commercial users. Consequently, EUROBIKE, taking place in Friedrichshafen from 8-10 July 2018, will introduce a Cargo category for the first time this year.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, the United Nations (UN) declared June 3 as the official World Bicycle Day. This initiative aims to promote cycling in all its forms, raising awareness of the multiple societal benefits associated with biking for both transportation and leisure purposes. Brook Boyer, recognizing the bicycle as more than just a means of urban mobility, asserts that we need such a day: \"It is the top choice for progress in the most literal sense.\" Bicycles contribute to sustainable consumption and production, support school attendance, especially for girls in rural areas of Africa, and even increase agricultural production in Zambia through projects supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), headquartered in New York with regional offices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, and Mexico, works globally to design and implement high-quality transportation systems and policy solutions. The ITDP has successfully advocated for bike lane networks and bike parking plans in many cities while collaborating with local authorities to ensure their implementation. Recently, the ITDP played a pivotal role in launching new bike-sharing programs in Mexico and China.\n\nCurrently, urban planners and architects focus on developing bicycle-centric concepts that prioritize user appeal and perceived traffic safety. Creating a forgiving infrastructure is key, along with generating enthusiasm among cyclists and encouraging non-cyclists to embrace biking. These concepts are at the forefront of development across numerous urban areas.\n\nLondon is heavily investing in \"Cycle Superhighways,\" dedicated cycle routes linking outer London to central London. These superhighways provide safer, faster, and more direct routes into the city compared to existing \"Quietways.\" Former mayor Boris Johnson emphasized the benefits of getting more people on their bikes: reducing road, bus, and rail congestion, cutting pollution, and improving overall quality of life. His successor, Sadiq Khan, has pledged \u00a3770 million towards cycling initiatives during his four-year term. The cycle paths, completely segregated from other modes of transportation, form the crown jewels of the Superhighway network, contributing to a significant reduction in car traffic.\n\nIn Australia's Melbourne, the Bicycle Plan 2016-2020, titled \"A Connected City,\" focuses on safe cycling in urban planning, with an emphasis on metropolitan objectives. They aim to create a functioning network that caters to people of all ages, promoting a cleaner and less congested city.\ufffd\ufffd\n\nLocated in China's southeastern coast, the port city of Xiamen boasts the world's longest cycle path, spanning 7.6 kilometers. Built beneath the city's existing bus-overland transportation system, this skyway for bicycles connects major residential and business districts. Able to accommodate over 2000 bicycles, the 4.8-meter wide path seamlessly integrates with 11 bus stations and two subway stations. Additionally, bike rental services are available alongside personal bike parking spaces.\n\nDISSING + WEITLING, a Danish architecture studio, spearheaded the bridge project in Xiamen and served as the architect behind Copenhagen's Cycle Superhighways and The Bicycle Snake in 2014. These initiatives played a transformative role in making Copenhagen one of the world's leading cycling cities and continue to serve as models for urban biking infrastructure worldwide.\n\nEindhoven in the Netherlands showcases futuristic accents with architectural wonders like the Hovenring bicycle bridge, offering a circular route 70 meters above ground (built by ipv Delft). Alternatively, it exudes poetic beauty with the Van Gogh Path illuminated with patterns inspired by Vincent van Gogh's famous painting, \"The Starry Night.\"\n\nBicycle manufacturers are meeting the demands of the urban cycling trend by offering extraordinary products across all segments, including e-bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and belt-drive bikes for private, commercial, and municipal usage.\n\nBrian Hohl, an industrial designer and inventor from DIAVELO - Protanium B.V (Accell Group), passionately advocates for integrating light and compact lithium batteries into electric bicycles. \"Our design philosophy revolves around creating inviting and easy-to-use electric bikes for everyone. The battery should be seamlessly integrated into the bicycle but also easily removable for charging.\" Protanium's green approach to transportation also led them to invest their expertise in the EBIKE4DELIVERY project, aiming to create greener and healthier jobs while delivering meals throughout Europe. The use of heavy-duty cargo bikes for package delivery is another emerging application gaining popularity worldwide.\n\nGermany's largest parcel service providers, including DHL, dpd, GLS, Hermes, and UPS, have established a shared distribution point utilizing twelve cargo bikes stationed on 750 square meters of land provided free of charge by the Pankow district. These rent-free micro-depots, each measuring 14 square meters, dispatch the bikes within a radius of three to five kilometers. This innovative approach replaces motorized delivery vehicles, effectively reducing road congestion caused by traditional delivery methods.\n\nChina and Taiwan dominate the global bicycle market, responsible for approximately 90% of its production. Europe alone sells nearly 30 million bicycles and EPACs (Electric Power-Assisted Cycles) annually, with approximately 13 million produced within the EU.\n\nInterestingly, China has witnessed a significant shift away from bicycles as the primary mode of transportation in favor of cars over the past few years. Consequently, this poses a massive challenge for major Chinese cities. However, many cities are now countering this trend by implementing bike-sharing programs to encourage cycling while addressing the issue of road congestion. The supplier market in this segment is rapidly expanding alongside this demand.\n\nProviders like Call-a-bike (Deutsche Bahn), Jump Bikes, Nice Ride, and Nextbike are facing increasing competition from Asian counterparts such as Mobike, Obike, Ofo, and Yobike. Mobike, for instance, ventured into the European market with its rental bike system in Manchester in 2017 and has since deployed 700 bikes in Berlin. The company continues its aggressive expansion strategies across Europe and the USA.\n\nHowever, the Chinese bike-sharing boom did not meet expectations and created challenges in terms of excessive oversupply and inadequate infrastructure and regulations. Dockless rental bikes have cluttered the streets of many major Chinese cities, leading to concerns regarding their integration in Europe.\n\nFurthermore, rumors have emerged about service providers leveraging collected data for targeted purposes. The smart usage of bike-sharing, managed through smartphone apps, opens up possibilities for data-driven solutions. This growing trend will subsequently extend to other last-mile transportation options such as e-scooters and semi-automated shuttle buses, augmenting individual mobility in smart cities.\n\nLegal Notice"

      "text": "A Metric for Comparing the Bicycle Friendliness of American Cities\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, I'm constantly amazed by how much faster it is to travel within the borough on a bike. The subway system mainly caters to routes leading to Manhattan, making transportation within the other boroughs less efficient. Biking often provides a more effective alternative to taking the subway. Regardless of whether we personally use bicycles or not, it's worth considering how cities plan for bicyclists, or in some cases, fall short.\n\nWhile individuals can make their own choices about transportation, these decisions are influenced by the larger context of transportation infrastructure that determines accessibility and convenience of different modes of travel like roads, subway routes, and bike lanes. These choices have a significant impact on our environment and public health. In fact, transportation accounts for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, and it plays a crucial role in pollution exposure and physical activity levels. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity, obesity, and being overweight contribute to 11 percent of global deaths each year.\n\nTo explore what U.S. cities are doing to facilitate bicycle commuting and identify opportunities for improvement, I delved into the subject during a sustainability indicators class. Our instructor, Alex de Sherbinin, is an expert in environmental data analysis and the associate director for science applications at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University. His course focused on sustainability indicators, which serve as measurements for social, economic, and environmental systems. By combining various indicators, we can create aggregate indices that provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, lawmakers, and those curious about creating a more sustainable world. Furthermore, fostering experience-sharing among decision-makers is a pivotal tool for enhancing urban infrastructure and promoting environmental and social resilience in cities.\n\nMotivated by the interconnectedness of socioeconomics and the environment, I set out to develop an index that goes beyond existing rankings of bicycle-friendly cities by incorporating environmental health factors. While addressing air pollution may not be an immediate concern in terms of improving bicycle infrastructure, including public health indicators is vital for assessing sustainability from a multidisciplinary perspective. This kind of holistic thinking not only aids our understanding of environmental health issues and vulnerabilities but also contributes to building resilient communities.\n\nMy index takes into account social infrastructure, bicycle education programs, and air quality. To offer a comprehensive view, I incorporated indicators such as the availability of youth and adult bicycle education programs, the number of full-time employees dedicated to bicycle-related matters in a city, and average exposure levels to three major air pollutants. Additionally, my index evaluates city infrastructure and safety based on factors like miles of bicycle infrastructure (including bike lanes, routes, and pathways) relative to the city's size, availability of bike-sharing programs per capita, and bicyclist fatality rates. However, sustainability indexes exclude indicators that cities cannot directly influence, such as topography or extreme temperatures.\n\nIn constructing the index, I gathered data from reputable sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Association of City Transportation Officials, and the League of American Bicyclists. I also sought input from experts both within and outside the academic community to determine the most important and relevant indicators. After conducting statistical analyses and computations to minimize bias and normalize the data, the final step involved combining all the indicators into a single index using appropriate weights.\n\nExamining the data compiled allows us to rank the largest U.S. cities according to their bicycle friendliness, while taking into account the range of factors considered. Cities like San Francisco, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Denver received high rankings, while San Antonio, Detroit, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City ranked lowest.\n\nThe index also unveils patterns and correlations within the data. For example, there is a negative correlation between the rate of bicycle commuting and the rate of bicyclist fatalities. This means that cities with higher percentages of commuters who bike to work tend to have lower cyclist fatality rates, and vice versa. This finding presents a compelling argument for policymakers to advocate for improved infrastructure that encourages more people to commute by bike.\n\nAs climate change continues to transform our environment, it also prompts us to reevaluate our relationship with it. Sustainability indicators offer a fresh perspective on both our built and natural surroundings, enabling us to envision a more resilient future. Our vision of the future influences our actions and ultimately shapes the trajectory of climate change. By utilizing sustainability indices to enhance access to alternative transportation methods, cities can promote cycling and contribute to altering the cycle of climate change.\n\nThis article was originally published by the Earth Institute at Columbia University and has been republished here with permission."

      "text": "Cycling for a Sustainable Future: Promoting Eco-Friendly Transportation\n\nArticle:\n\nValuable Insights & Essential Resources\nCan the simple act of riding a bike combat global warming? The answer is a resounding yes. By encouraging more individuals to embrace cycling as a sustainable form of transportation, we can make a significant impact on our environment.\n\nThe Environmental Impact of Transportation\nTransportation currently contributes to about 25% of global carbon emissions, with an alarming 80% of urban residents opting for high-emission motor vehicles for their daily commute. Surprisingly, most trips are shorter than 10km, a distance easily covered by bicycle. Whether it's cycling directly to your destination or using it as a means to connect to public transport, such as the availability of secure bike parking like Parkiteer, bikes hold immense potential for reducing emissions.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of California, Davis, if 22% of all transport trips worldwide were made on bicycles or e-bikes, we would witness a remarkable 47% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by 2050.

      "text": "Why Cycling is Key for Environmentally Sustainable Cities\n\nCycling has long been hailed as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation with the potential to foster the growth of sustainable cities. But what exactly are the advantages, and how do they contribute to urban development? Let's delve into three primary benefits of cycling and bicycle networks, emphasizing their positive role in creating environmentally sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nCompared to other means of transport, bicycles have incredibly low energy requirements. A study conducted in the United States in 2008 revealed that producing a carbon-framed road bicycle, weighing around 7.2kg, consumes only 11,546,658,000 joules of energy. In stark contrast, manufacturing a \"generic car\" demands a whooping 118,284,466,000 joules (Figures via WattzOn). While variations exist based on bicycle types and external factors, it remains evident that bikes possess significantly lower embodied energy.\n\nMoreover, building bicycle lanes requires less energy compared to constructing roads for motor vehicles. They occupy less space, necessitate reduced foundations and fewer materials, and demand less energy-intensive maintenance.\n\nAir Quality Enhancement\nThe environmental sustainability of bicycles goes beyond their energy efficiency. When individuals shift from private vehicles, notorious polluters, to bicycles - which are emission-free during use - cities witness reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. If a substantial number of people transition to cycling, these benefits become tangible for urban dwellers at large.\n\nEach person who swaps driving a car for riding a bike leaves a smaller personal carbon footprint while causing a decline in carbon emissions. By making cycling a highly appealing alternative to other transportation modes, as some cities have already achieved, reaching such a modal shift becomes more feasible. Realizing an enhanced bicycle network alongside a city's other cycling infrastructure requirements can translate into actual improvements in air quality.\n\nNoise Pollution Reduction\nPollution encompasses more than just emissions; noise levels in cities should also be regarded as pollutants with associated long-term health risks. According to Alok Jha, noise pollution can elevate stress hormone levels, including cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, even during sleep. Prolonged circulation of these hormones in the bloodstream raises the likelihood of life-threatening physiological problems.\n\nCertain cities have started incorporating noise pollution into their sustainability agendas. Vancouver's 2020 action plan, aiming to become the \"world's greenest\" city, envisions a future characterized by minimal pollution, cleaner air, reduced machine noise, and amplified birdsong. Although this might sometimes sound like a sustainable fairy tale, the inclusion of noise pollution reduction in their agenda implies that the issue is being considered, at least in select cities. The same report identifies an increase in cycling levels as crucial to community development, subtly hinting at the bicycle's potential to combat noise pollution.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that bicycle networks and bicycles alone cannot provide an all-encompassing solution - that would oversimplify matters. The analysis of urban air quality is intricate, influenced by factors like weather conditions, geography, and industrial activities - variables outside the control of bicycle networks and varying across cities. Moreover, cities will always consume energy, emit carbon, and generate noise to a certain extent. Nonetheless, prioritizing bicycles over automated transportation options reduces energy consumption, carbon emissions, and noise production.\n\nPhoto: lopify. This article has been updated from its original publication in November 2011 to reflect recent trends and developments in the realm of biking for environmentally sustainable cities."

Drawing inspiration from Europe, where livability standards are high, particularly in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, we can learn valuable lessons about urban sustainability and the transformative potential of bicycles.\n\nHistorically, American cities thrived with streetcars and bicycles before automobiles took center stage in the 1930s. However, the absence of a balanced transportation system, maintaining both streetcars and bicycles alongside cars, led us to become heavily reliant on automobiles, contributing to our current state of unhealthiness and car-dependent living.\n\nRecognizing the economic impact and health benefits of cycling, Denmark has made significant investments in bike infrastructure due to their tax-funded universal healthcare system. Research demonstrates that adults who commute to work by bicycle experience a remarkable 30% reduction in mortality rates. In Copenhagen alone, annual savings of $100 million have been attributed to improved public health. Moreover, a healthier workforce results in increased productivity and contributes to reduced road maintenance costs and congestion. Building grade-separated bikeways costs approximately $2 million per mile per side, which is fully recovered within five years. The economic impact study conducted by the city estimates that every mile cycled yields a net gain of 21 cents for society, while driving a car leads to a net loss of 12 cents per mile. These figures encompass savings within the public sector as well as generating economic growth within the private sector.\n\nBicycle commuting plays a pivotal role in achieving urban sustainability. Copenhagen surpasses the entire United States in terms of people commuting to work by bike, averaging distances of 3 \u00bd miles each way. Over the past three decades, Copenhagen has actively reclaimed space from cars, prioritizing the creation of extensive bike infrastructure by removing car-parking and reallocating road space.\n\nThe Netherlands boasts a cycling culture envied by many countries worldwide. The Dutch Cycling Embassy, a public-private organization, capitalizes on their acclaimed urban transportation model to promote urban mobility as a sustainable solution. As urbanization poses challenges globally, the Dutch experience firsthand the contribution of bicycles to better health, enhanced livability, improved road safety, cleaner air, efficient traffic flow, reduced social isolation, and a boosted economy.\n\nMarketing bicycles as a viable form of transit in the United States requires a paradigm shift, reframing bicycle users as regular citizens rather than just \"cyclists\" belonging to a niche subculture. Copenhagenize, a Danish consulting firm, offers guidance on reshaping perceptions through behavior and marketing campaigns. Inspired by the concept of developing \"complete streets,\" as championed by the American non-profit organization of the same name, U.S. cities have made strides in this direction.\n\nAs American cities face financial constraints, vacant sidewalks, and debates over accommodating growth, they can find inspiration in Amsterdam and Copenhagen, popular tourist destinations with limited land mass for expansion. To ensure long-term vitality, American cities must concentrate development within existing built-up areas, aligning with the desires of today's singles and young families seeking vibrant town life accessible by safe walking and biking paths, complete with shops, entertainment, and urban amenities. By incorporating extensive bike infrastructure akin to Dutch and Danish models, we unlock the potential for smart growth while maintaining our affinity for automobiles.\n\nWith a conscious effort to emulate European successes, embracing the simplicity of bicycles becomes the catalyst for transforming American cities into sustainable havens \u2013 reestablishing a sense of balance in our transportation systems, enhancing public health, and revitalizing our downtown cores."

      "text": "Drone Surveillance of Vessel Emissions: A Life-Saving Measure and Health Shield\n\nOcean-faring cargo ships play a vital role in transporting essential goods to our ports. However, their operations contribute to the grave issue of air pollution. The burning of inexpensive and low-quality fuel leads to the release of sulfur and nitrogen oxides at alarming levels. These emissions, combined with particulate matter, form a toxic cocktail that poses significant risks to respiratory and circulatory health.\n\nRecognizing this urgent concern, California implemented the California Sulfur Rule in 2014, mandating ships to use cleaner fuel within 200 nautical miles of the coast. However, enforcing this regulation has proven to be a formidable challenge. Currently, only a handful of officers from the California Air Resources Board can inspect ships' fuel randomly at the pier, limiting the inspection rate to just two ships per day. With an estimated influx of over 6,600 cargo ships annually from 2021 to 2032, it becomes clear that a more efficient solution is imperative. Furthermore, due to the potential savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars per voyage by utilizing cheap and illegal fuel, there exists a strong incentive for ship operators to violate both state and federal laws.\n\nThankfully, a groundbreaking report prepared by environmental science students at UCLA highlights a possible technological breakthrough. This report emphasizes the deployment of advanced sensors mounted on industrial-scale drones, capable of soaring through a ship's exhaust plume to detect compliance with fuel regulations. Produced as part of the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability's senior practicum, this study showcases how students, under the guidance of faculty experts, tackle real-world environmental challenges.\n\nNoah Garrison, the program's director, commended the project by stating, \"This undertaking perfectly exemplifies the Practicum's strength, enabling our students to take the lead in addressing pressing environmental problems locally and globally while learning from esteemed scientists and policy experts across UCLA's diverse research programs.\"\n\nThe student team collaborated with the ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused tech company, to assess the impact of drone-assisted enforcement of the California Sulfur Rule on public health. They conducted simulations for two scenarios: one where ships violated the regulation at a rate of 10%, similar to documented violations in European waters, and another scenario assuming full compliance with effective enforcement mechanisms. ADEPT estimates that between 20% and 25% of ships currently fail to meet the existing standards, heightening the significance of enhanced enforcement measures.\n\nAccording to the team's findings, adopting aerial monitoring techniques could prevent approximately 55 deaths annually caused by air pollution in Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro\u2014the port communities examined in the study. Beyond the preservation of lives, this approach would yield approximately $600 million in savings on medical costs. Initial projections estimate that each year, better enforcement could prevent around 2,600 cases of asthma and 1,200 instances of asthma requiring emergency room visits or hospitalization.\n\nRyan Hallman, the lead author of the research study and a recent UCLA graduate, emphasized, \"When ships burn fuel with high sulfur content near the coast, they increase particulate matter in the air, primarily affecting communities near commercial ports\u2014often disadvantaged communities.\"\n\nThe study further revealed a critical oversight by air quality modelers responsible for oceangoing vessel analysis; these modelers erroneously assumed full adherence to the California Rule by ship operators. This erroneous assumption results in an underestimation of the actual air pollution endured by disadvantaged port-adjacent communities, hindering countermeasures aimed at safeguarding public health.\n\nAdditionally, the research identified a significant financial motivation for ship operators to circumvent regulations\u2014a motivation that far outweighs the current penalties imposed should violators be caught. In court, penalties have ranged from a mere $7,500 to $10,000 per day spent in port.\n\nDemonstrating the feasibility of the proposed solution, a drone-mounted sensor system was showcased on May 7, World Asthma Day, at the Port of L.A. Esteemed individuals, including Mary Nichols, Chair of the California Air Resources Board, witnessed the demonstration involving the T.S. Golden Bear\u2014an educational training ship operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. Piloted by Flying Lion, Inc., the six-propeller drone penetrated the ship's exhaust plume, effectively determining if the vessel was using fuel within regulatory limits.\n\nNichols emphasized the importance of enforcing anti-pollution laws at sea to protect the well-being of coastal communities. As she stated, \"Whenever we find technology that holds promise to detect violations and hold the vessel owners accountable, we want to test it out.\" Access to the Golden Bear required approval from numerous high-ranking officials, ranging from port security personnel to those overseeing the ship itself. Although the approval process spanned months, the entire plume-sniffing endeavor took less than ten minutes from take-off to landing. Most importantly, it furnished accurate results, affirming that the ship adhered to the prescribed fuel standards.\n\nApart from conducting public health research, the students presented their technological innovation to various stakeholders, including the Port of Long Beach and several air quality agencies. Encouragingly, during a meeting in San Francisco, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District pledged $275,000 towards co-funding a demonstration project. This initiative aims to adapt the technology to California's unique legal, geographic, security, and safety requirements.\n\nAlex Spataru, CEO of the Adept Group, Inc., highlighted the positive economic aspect of drone-enforced regulations, particularly citing successful implementations in Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Following the introduction of aerial monitoring of seagoing vessels five years ago, Denmark witnessed a 50% reduction in sulfur-related air pollution.\n\nSubsequent UCLA student research teams will delve deeper into sensor technology, particulate matter pollution, and public health implications. If progress continues, these methods could be expanded to protect all coastal communities along the entirety of the US West Coast.\n\nSpataru expressed optimism about the future, asserting, \"We can cost-effectively eliminate violations with proven technologies, creating positive public health outcomes throughout California\u2014particularly in the most vulnerable communities.\"\n\n[Top image: Industrial strength drone equipped with sulfur sensors for testing ship emissions. | Photo by Nicki Aviel/UCLA]"

However, the term \"drone\" encompasses a wide range of applications. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a drone as a remote-controlled piloted aircraft or missile. The military refers to them as UAVs or RPAS (remotely piloted aerial systems). Drones used for environmental tasks are often called \"eco-drones.\" Personal drones are referred to as \"civilian drones\" and are typically smaller than military models. While there is no standardized definition, drone expert Michael Perry suggests that autonomy is a defining factor. For a device to be considered a drone, it should possess the capability to fly, hover, or navigate without pilot input. Current market offerings are diverse, including quadcopters, fixed-wing drones, and hybrid models. Regardless of their specific design, all drones are essentially flying robots, and they have gained widespread popularity in recent years.\n\nHow Do Drones Work?\nWhile the concept of drones may seem complex, understanding their basic principles does not require the genius of Nicola Tesla. Vijay Kumar from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania provides a concise overview of how drones operate, specifically focusing on piloted quadcopter models. Lifted by four propellers rotating at the same speed, a drone can hover in place. Adjusting the speed of the propellers allows for altitude control, with faster rotations enabling upward movement and slower rotations facilitating descent. Differential thrust produced by varying the speed of individual propellers determines the left-to-right movement.\n\nCommunication between drones and controllers requires different methods depending on the device's size and purpose. Larger drones often use radio waves, while smartphone-controlled models utilize Wi-Fi and other communication technologies. Advanced drones come equipped with built-in features such as GPS, sensors, infrared systems, measuring tools, and cameras capable of capturing high-resolution imagery. With their capacity to capture multi-angle photographs, drones can generate 3D models.\n\nSurveillance and Mapping:\nOne major sector benefiting from drone technology is surveillance and monitoring. Drones offer flexibility, operating under cloud cover and incorporating high-resolution cameras and advanced imaging systems. Their use in monitoring wildlife conservation, environmental protection, and deforestation prevention is increasingly popular.

      "text": "Drone surveillance of ship emissions holds incredible potential in saving lives and safeguarding public health. While cargo ships play a crucial role in transporting goods, they also contribute to air pollution, emitting harmful sulfur and nitrogen oxides along with particulate matter. However, enforcing regulations surrounding fuel usage remains challenging. California's Sulfur Rule, implemented in 2014, mandates the use of cleaner fuel within a specific distance from the coast. Nevertheless, ensuring compliance is an arduous task that limits inspections to only two ships per day.\n\nThankfully, a recent report by UCLA environmental science students highlights the transformative role of drone technology in this domain. The report proposes the utilization of advanced sensors mounted on large-scale industrial drones deployed into a ship's exhaust plume to detect violations of fuel regulations. This innovation would revolutionize enforcement efforts by providing real-time monitoring capabilities, unlike the current random checks carried out by the California Air Resources Board officers.\n\nThis groundbreaking project was undertaken as part of the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability senior practicum program, where students collaborate with faculty advisers to develop solutions for real-world environmental challenges. By partnering with the ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused technology company, the student team aimed to explore the impact of drone-assisted enforcement on public health in relation to the California Sulfur Rule. Their study considered two scenarios: one accounting for a 10% violation rate (similar to documented cases in European waters) and another assuming complete compliance.\n\nAccording to estimates provided by ADEPT, around 20 to 25 percent of ships currently violate sulfur emission standards. By implementing enhanced enforcement measures through aerial monitoring, the research projects a significant reduction in air pollution-related fatalities and associated medical costs. Specifically, monitoring could prevent 55 deaths annually caused by air pollution in port communities like Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro. Additionally, the improved enforcement would avert approximately 2,600 asthma cases and 1,200 incidents of asthma morbidity requiring emergency room visits or hospitalization. These findings highlight the substantial positive impact this technology could have on public health outcomes.\n\nThe study also sheds light on misconceptions prevalent among air quality modelers who assumed full compliance with the California Rule by ship operators. This erroneous assumption undermines the urgency to address air pollution issues faced by disadvantaged communities near ports, hindering the implementation of effective countermeasures. Furthermore, the research underscores the financial incentive for ship operators to cheat, as the potential savings derived from using cheap, illegal fuel can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars per voyage, significantly outweighing the penalties imposed for violating the law.\n\nDemonstrating the viability of this technology, a drone-mounted sensor system was recently showcased at the Port of L.A. during World Asthma Day. The drone, operated by Flying Lion, Inc., flew into the exhaust plume of the training ship T. S. Golden Bear, which is operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. In less than ten minutes, the drone successfully detected whether the ship was burning clean fuel within the regulatory limits.\n\nThese developments have garnered substantial attention from key stakeholders such as the Port of Long Beach and various air quality agencies. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District even pledged $275,000 towards co-funding a demonstration project aimed at adapting this technology to meet California's legal, geographical, security, and safety requirements. Countries like Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands have already recognized the effectiveness of drone technologies in maritime enforcement, experiencing remarkable reductions in sulfur air pollution since their implementation.\n\nLooking ahead, future research teams at UCLA will delve deeper into sensor technology, particulate matter pollution, and public health impacts. If successful, these methods could be expanded to protect communities along the entire west coast of the United States. Alex Spataru, CEO of the Adept Group, Inc., emphasizes that cost-effective deployment of proven technologies can eliminate violations and generate positive public health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable communities.\n\nEmbracing drone technology for monitoring ship emissions demonstrates immense promise in combating air pollution, preserving public health, and promoting sustainable practices within the maritime industry. As advancements continue, it is crucial to leverage these innovations to create a safer, cleaner, and healthier environment for coastal communities situated near major ports."

      "text": "Drones: Revolutionizing Sustainable Development\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have long been associated with military operations. However, these versatile devices are now finding applications in various other fields. Recognizing the potential of drone technology beyond military applications, aid workers and environmentalists are harnessing their power to propel sustainable development.\n\nAccording to a United Nations report, the number of countries using UAVs for military, commercial, or civil purposes has increased significantly in recent years. Now, these tiny flying machines equipped with cutting-edge technology and costing less than $300 USD have become indispensable tools in the fight against pollution, social injustice, and environmental degradation.\n\nDrones act as invaluable aids in compiling reports, analyzing situations, and gathering data faster, objectively, and securely. They bridge the gap between satellite imagery and ground surveying, allowing activists, scientists, and aid workers to access and explore remote areas without the need for large teams on the ground. These devices not only provide monitoring capabilities but also actively contribute to humanitarian efforts. Drones can deliver medical supplies to inaccessible regions, plant trees to combat deforestation, and even serve as communication stations.\n\nSo, what exactly are drones? Originally developed for military purposes, drones were designed to carry out risky missions in war zones. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a drone as a \"remote-less controlled piloted aircraft or missile.\" The term UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) or RPAS (remotely piloted aerial system) is used in military contexts, while drones used for environmental tasks are dubbed \"eco-drones.\" Personal drones, smaller than those used by the military, are often referred to as \"civilian drones.\" Michael Perry, manager of drone-production company DJI, suggests that devices can be classified as drones when they possess a certain level of autonomy, enabling them to fly, hover, or navigate without input from a pilot. Small drones available for sale are often called quadcopters, featuring four propellers instead of one. Regardless of the specific designations, all these devices remain \"robots that fly,\" gaining immense popularity in recent years.\n\nNow, let's dive into how drones work.

      "text": "Title:\nDrone Surveillance for Ship Emissions: A Lifesaving Measure to Safeguard Health\n\nArticle:\nThe presence of cargo ships is crucial for the transportation of goods to ports worldwide. However, these vessels also contribute significantly to air pollution, posing risks to public health. The combustion of low-grade fuel by these ships releases hazardous sulfur and nitrogen oxides, along with particulate matter, forming a toxic combination that negatively impacts respiratory and circulatory systems.\n\nTo address this issue, California implemented the California Sulfur Rule in 2014, mandating cleaner fuel usage within 200 nautical miles of its coast. Nevertheless, enforcing this regulation remains a challenge. Currently, only a handful of California Air Resources Board officers inspect ships' fuel randomly at piers, limiting their capability to examine just two ships daily. Considering that over 6,600 cargo ships are projected to dock each year from 2021\u20132032, there is a pressing need for a more efficient enforcement method. Violating the state law and its federal counterpart can save ship operators substantial amounts of money by using inexpensive and illegal fuel.\n\nFortunately, a recent report by UCLA environmental science students proposes a solution leveraging cutting-edge technology. The report emphasizes the potential role of robust sensors mounted on industrial-scale drones that can maneuver through a ship's exhaust plume to identify whether the burned fuel complies with legal standards. This innovative approach highlights the promising intersection between drone capabilities and maritime regulation enforcement.\n\nConducted under the guidance of faculty advisors, this study was part of the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability senior practicum. It exemplifies the program's commitment to empowering students to tackle real-world environmental challenges while benefiting from the expertise of scientists and policy experts associated with UCLA's diverse research programs.\n\nIn partnership with ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused tech company, the team examined how drone-augmented enforcement of the California Sulfur Rule could impact public health. Two scenarios were modeled: one assuming a 10% violation rate (consistent with documented cases in European waters) and another imagining rigorous enforcement and full compliance. According to estimates provided by ADEPT, approximately 20 to 25 percent of ships currently violate the existing standards.\n\nBy implementing aerial monitoring and enhanced enforcement techniques, it is projected that roughly 55 deaths caused by air pollution could be prevented annually in communities near the ports of Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro. This initiative would not only save lives but also lead to an estimated $600 million reduction in medical costs. Furthermore, the initial findings suggest that improved enforcement measures could prevent around 2,600 asthma cases and 1,200 instances of acute attacks requiring emergency room visits or hospitalization every year.\n\nRyan Hallman, a recent UCLA graduate and lead author of the research, emphasizes the detrimental impact of ships burning high-sulfur fuel close to the coast on coastal communities, particularly disadvantaged populations. These communities experience higher levels of particulate matter due to their proximity to commercial ports.\n\nThe study also reveals a critical oversight: air quality modelers working for districts responsible for oceangoing vessels incorrectly assumed full compliance by ship operators with the California Rule. This false assumption understates the actual level of air pollution endured by disadvantaged port communities, hindering effective countermeasures.\n\nFurthermore, the research demonstrates that the financial incentives for ship operators to cheat far outweigh the current penalties imposed on violators in the unlikely event of detection. At present, fines range from a mere $7,500 to $10,000 per day in port.\n\nTo showcase the potential of this drone-based system, a demonstration was conducted at the Port of L.A. on World Asthma Day, observed on May 7. The demonstration featured a six-propeller drone flown by Flying Lion, Inc., which adeptly navigated the exhaust plume of the T.S. Golden Bear\u2014a training vessel operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. Noteworthy officials, such as Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, were present to witness the event. While securing access to the Golden Bear required several months of approvals from various authorities, the entire plume-sniffing process took less than 10 minutes from take-off to landing. The results unequivocally confirmed compliance with fuel regulations.\n\nApart from the public health research, the student team presented the drone technology to stakeholders including the Port of Long Beach and numerous air quality agencies. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District has committed $275,000 to co-fund a demonstration project in collaboration with the implementation of adaptable technology tailored to California's legal, geographic, security, and safety requirements.\n\nAlex Spataru, CEO of Adept Group, Inc., highlights the successful adoption of drone enforcement in countries with intense port activities like Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Denmark, for instance, has witnessed a 50% reduction in sulfur air pollution since the implementation of aerial monitoring of ocean-going vessels five years ago.\n\nFuture research teams at UCLA will delve further into sensor technologies, particulate matter pollution, and the broader impact of this initiative on public health. If progress continues, similar methods may be expanded to safeguard coastal communities along the entire U.S. West Coast.\n\nSpataru believes that cost-effective elimination of violations utilizing proven technologies can yield positive public health outcomes throughout California, especially in the most vulnerable communities.\n\n(Image source: Nicki Aviel/UCLA)"

However, in today's Arizona farming landscape, an increasing number of farmers are turning to miniature unmanned aircraft, known as drones, to enhance yields while conserving water and reducing costs.\nKelly Thorp, an agricultural engineer working at the U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, spearheads the use of drones to monitor the center's experimental fields. Harnessing detailed imaging technology, Thorp captures intricate aerial views of cotton plants, meticulously assessing the soil conditions and determining precise irrigation requirements.\n\"These formidable technologies empower us to regularly survey fields, facilitating informed decision-making,\" Thorp remarked. \"By maximizing accuracy, we can optimize our water utilization and increase overall efficiency.\"\nWhile irrigated agriculture has been entrenched in the Sonoran Desert for over a millennium, farmers face the ongoing challenge of adapting to changing weather patterns. Arizona has grappled with a protracted drought spanning two decades, and climatologists anticipate continued warming and drying trends in the Southwest.\nThe monsoon season of 2019 delivered scant rainfall across most of the state, causing the Arizona Department of Water Resources to report, \"Dry conditions in July and August persisted into September, undoing the long-term drought improvements achieved in the last quarter after an exceptionally wet winter and relatively humid spring.\"\nConsequently, the severity of long-standing drought conditions escalated, especially in the northern two-thirds of the state. This persistent dilemma necessitates constant vigilance from farmers. By incorporating drone technology to supervise water usage on their crops, farmers and agricultural engineers assume a pivotal role in environmental stewardship, actively conserving water\u2014the world's most precious resource.\n\"Utilizing information-guided decisions regarding resource allocation distinguishes drone-assisted farming from traditional methods,\" explained Pedro Andrade, assistant professor of agriculture at the University of Arizona. After a drone conducts a comprehensive survey of the plants, the data is analyzed and integrated into a machine that precisely calculates the watering requirements for each plot.\nDrones, whether multirotor or fixed-wing, serve various functions, including evaluating crop conditions, determining fertilizer needs, predicting yield potential, monitoring water quality, and identifying leaks, pests, and disease infestations. Equipped with both video and still-image cameras, thermal sensors capable of detecting surface temperatures, and LIDAR technology facilitating the creation of 3D field maps, drones revolutionize precision agriculture.\nThorp summarized, \"After this extensive process, I obtain a mapped representation of my field divided into discrete sections, each receiving customized amounts of water. As a result, drones hold immense promise for bolstering the efficiency of our agricultural decision-making processes.\"\nFarmers operate within a high-risk, costly industry, and many remain skeptical about embracing new technologies such as drones, attested Paul Brierley, executive director of the Yuma Center of Excellence for Desert Agriculture.\n\"They need assurance that investing an additional $20 per acre in acquiring drone-generated data will genuinely lead to improved, larger, safer, or otherwise superior outcomes,\" he emphasized.\nNumerous companies presently offer drone farming services, and the domain continues to evolve at a rapid pace.\n\"We are currently in a phase where these technology providers are striving to prove themselves; various companies are offering services, often through trial periods,\" Brierly added.\nThorp and his team have diligently tested the capabilities of this technology on their cotton crops over the past year and are now poised to extend their research to other types of produce.\n\n"

      "text": "Title: Drone Surveillance of Ship Emissions: A Lifesaving Measure for Health Protection\n\nArticle:\nContainer ships are responsible for transporting essential goods to our ports, but they also unleash air pollution into the atmosphere. Burning low-quality fuel leads to the release of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, along with harmful particulate matter, compromising respiratory and circulatory health.\n\nTo tackle this issue, California introduced the California Sulfur Rule in 2014, aiming to enforce the use of cleaner fuel within 200 nautical miles of the coast. However, enforcing this regulation remains a challenge. Currently, only a few officers from the California Air Resources Board randomly inspect ships' fuel at the pier, limiting their capacity to inspect only two ships per day. Considering that over 6,600 cargo ships are projected to dock each year from 2021 to 2032, compliance becomes an even more pressing concern. The temptation to flout the law and opt for cheap, illegal fuel presents a substantial financial incentive to ship operators.\n\nFortunately, a recent report by UCLA environmental science students suggests that technology may provide a solution. This report proposes the use of powerful sensors mounted on industrial-scale drones, capable of flying through a ship's exhaust plume to detect if the burned fuel adheres to legal standards.\n\nThe study was conducted as part of the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability senior practicum, where student teams work on year-long projects under the supervision of faculty advisers to address real-world problems.\n\nCollaborating with the ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused tech company, the team aimed to determine how drone-enhanced enforcement of the California Sulfur Rule would impact public health. They developed models for two scenarios: one assuming a 10% cheating rate (similar to European violations) and another assuming full compliance. ADEPT estimates that 20 to 25 percent of ships currently violate existing standards.\n\nBy employing aerial monitoring for enhanced enforcement, the researchers project that it could prevent approximately 55 deaths annually due to air pollution in port communities such as Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro. Additionally, the improved enforcement would save around $600 million in medical costs. According to initial findings, effective enforcement could prevent approximately 2,600 cases of asthma and 1,200 instances of asthma morbidity, requiring emergency room visits or hospitalization.\n\nRyan Hallman, lead author of the research and a recent UCLA graduate, highlighted how burning higher-sulfur fuel near the coast increases particulate matter levels in surrounding regions and disproportionately affects disadvantaged communities residing near commercial ports.\n\nThe study also revealed that air quality modelers working with oceangoing vessels wrongly assumed ship operators fully complied with the California Rule. This false assumption downplays the true extent of air pollution endured by disadvantaged communities near ports and hinders the implementation of effective countermeasures.\n\nTo showcase the potential of implementing drone surveillance, a demonstration was held at the Port of L.A. on World Asthma Day, May 7. In the presence of onlookers and leaders, including Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, Flying Lion, Inc. piloted a six-propeller drone into the exhaust plume of the T.S. Golden Bear, a training ship operated by the California State University Maritime Academy.\n\nMary Nichols emphasized the importance of enforcing anti-pollution laws at sea to safeguard the health of coastal communities. She expressed her willingness to test promising technologies that can identify violations and hold vessel owners accountable.\n\nThough gaining access to the Golden Bear involved months of coordination with various public officials, including port security, the actual plume-sniffing process took less than 10 minutes, offering quick and accurate results confirming the ship's compliance with fuel regulations.\n\nIn addition to the public health research, the student team presented the technology to stakeholders such as the Port of Long Beach and multiple air quality agencies. One noteworthy commitment came from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which pledged $275,000 to co-fund a demonstration project focusing on adapting the drone technologies to California's legal, geographic, security, and safety requirements.\n\nAlex Spataru, CEO of the Adept Group, Inc., noted that drone enforcement has already proven cost-effective in countries like Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Denmark, for instance, successfully reduced its sulfur air pollution by 50% after implementing aerial monitoring of ocean-going vessels five years ago.\n\nFuture research teams at UCLA will delve further into sensor technology, particulate matter pollution, and the impact on public health. If successful, similar approaches could be expanded to protect coastal communities along the entire west coast of the United States.\n\nSpataru added, \"With proven technologies, we can cost-effectively eliminate violations, generating positive public health outcomes across California, particularly benefiting the most vulnerable communities.\"\n\nTop image: An industrially robust drone equipped with sulfur sensors is utilized to test ship emissions. | Nicki Aviel/UCLA"

      "text": "Drones: Revolutionizing Sustainable Development\nWhen one hears the term \"drone,\" thoughts of military operations and warfare often come to mind. However, drones, also known as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), are being increasingly utilized for various purposes outside of the military realm. Aid workers and environmentalists have recognized the potential of drones in contributing to sustainable development initiatives, expanding the applications of these devices far beyond their military origins.\n\nAccording to a United Nations report, the number of countries employing drones for military, commercial, or civil purposes has significantly increased from 41 countries in 2004 to 76 countries by 2011. In recent years, the possibilities offered by drone technology have become evident, with these compact yet technologically advanced devices serving as valuable tools in combating pollution, addressing social injustices, and driving sustainable development efforts. Remarkably, you can now own a drone for less than $300 USD.\n\nGiven the continuous and rapid development of drone technology and its multifaceted impact on society, this article aims to provide insights into its various technological and social implications. Bridging the gap between satellite imagery and ground surveying, drones offer fast and remote access to specific areas, empowering activists, scientists, and aid workers to compile reports, analyze situations, and gather data more efficiently, objectively, and securely than traditional methods. In addition to monitoring and observation, drones can be proactively employed to deliver medical supplies, support reforestation efforts, and combat deforestation.\n\nUnderstanding Drones:\nOriginally designed for military applications, drones were created to perform tasks in war zones, eliminating potential risks faced by human operators during airstrikes. While some politicians may emphasize the precision of drone strikes, they bear a controversial reputation associated with death and destruction in conflict areas. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a drone as a remote-controlled piloted aircraft or missile. The military refers to drones as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) or RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems), while the United Nations labels drones used for environmental purposes as \"eco-drones.\" Personal drones, smaller in size compared to military versions, are often referred to as \"civilian drones.\" As drones become more accessible to the public, new definitions are emerging. According to Michael Perry, manager of DJI, a leading drone production company, devices can be considered drones when they possess a certain level of autonomy, enabling them to fly, hover, or navigate without direct piloting input. Consequently, devices where users have full control over operations might not technically fall under the category of drones. Popularly known as \"quadcopters,\" small drones available for sale usually feature four propellers, resembling miniature helicopters. Whether called quadcopters, fixed-wing drones, or using specific brand names like Parrot AR drone or Sky Master Mini RC drone, they all fall under the umbrella of \"flying robots\" and have gained popularity in recent years. For the purpose of this article, drones are defined as unmanned aerial vehicles deployed for humanitarian and environmental development endeavors.\n\nMechanics of Drones:\nThe precursor to modern drones was the remotely-controlled vehicle, first patented by Nicola Tesla in 1898. While drone technology itself is intellectually remarkable, understanding its basic mechanics does not require the brilliance of Tesla. Vijay Kumar, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, provides a comprehensive overview of how drones, particularly the piloted quadcopter model, operate. Supported by four propellers rotating at the same speed, a drone can hover. The altitude of the drone is determined by the speed of the propellers \u2013 faster rotations elevate the drone, while slower rotations bring it down. Horizontal movement is achieved through differing levels of speed among at least two propellers.\n\nOperating drones remotely necessitates various means of communication with controllers. Large drones utilize radio waves, while smartphone-controlled drones rely on WiFi, with many other communication options available. Depending on the level of technological advancement, drones may incorporate built-in features such as GPS chips, sensors, infrared systems, measuring tools, and most commonly, cameras. Drones' high-resolution and multi-angle photographic capabilities enable the creation of detailed 3D models.\n\nApplications of Drones in Sustainable Development:\nDrones have garnered attention from activists and organizations focused on sustainable development due to their ability to reach remote areas quickly, collect data, and transport cargo. Challenges posed by high costs, security risks, limited infrastructure, and lack of available manpower in disaster relief efforts, wildlife conservation projects, and conflict zones motivate the exploration of drones as potentially transformative tools. This article classifies drones used in sustainable development into three broad categories based on their applications: surveillance and mapping, cargo transportation, and drones used as tools or appliances. It is important to acknowledge that there are devices not confined to a single category.\n\nEyes in the Sky: Surveillance and Mapping\nSurveillance and monitoring represent one of the largest sectors leveraging drone technology. Drones offer flexibility, the ability to operate under cloudy conditions, high-resolution cameras, and diverse camera systems, making them ideal for wildlife conservation, environmental protection, and combating deforestation. By surveying large areas of land, drones assist in monitoring and analyzing regions within protected areas, the agricultural sector, or conflict zones. There is also emerging interest among journalists in employing drones for reporting purposes.\n\nAgriculture:\nDrones offer cost-effective solutions for inspecting vast agricultural lands, surpassing traditional inspection methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Satellite imagery comprised approximately 70% of shots used to evaluate farm subsidy payments in the European Union in 2010. While these images cover extensive areas, they are not always accurate due to cloudy skies and shadows obstructing the view. Drones, however, fly at lower altitudes than satellites, allowing for more detailed observations from multiple angles. European Union experiments in France and Italy involve using drones to evaluate farm subsidy payments. Farmers themselves can also monitor their land using drones, and activist groups employ them to expose animal abuse threats on farms.\n\nJournalism:\nUAVs significantly enhance accessibility to remote locations, making them invaluable tools for journalists. For instance, certain quadcopters possess live broadcasting capabilities, flying at speeds of up to 50 km/h. These drones can capture breaking news or access dangerous locations, such as nuclear waste areas or conflict zones, reducing risks to reporters. As drone prices decrease and more people acquire camera-equipped drones, civic journalism becomes more democratic, enabling anyone to report from anywhere. This trend, known as \"sousveillance,\" has manifested in initiatives like the Occucopter, which emerged during the Occupy Wall Street protests. Protestor Tim Pool flew his drone above police-blocked areas, streaming live video of ground activities on the internet. While privacy concerns arise, the increasing availability of drones may lead to similar activism-oriented devices.\n\nLand Management:\nNon-profit organization Drone Adventures employs drones to map landscapes in development areas, with projects in Namibia focusing on the Savanna. Equipped with multispectral cameras, lightweight drones count rare vegetation and animals, aiding land management improvement initiatives. The University of Wageningen in the Netherlands also utilizes drone technology for land and water control research purposes.\n\nDeforestation and Wildlife Conservation:\nDrones play a crucial role in combating illegal logging and industrial deforestation. In the Peruvian Amazon, where an estimated 113,000 hectares of forest are cleared annually since 2001, drones monitor and help prevent environmentally damaging activities. The Amazon Basin Conservation Association employs fixed-wing drones equipped with advanced autopilot functions to survey the Los Amigos private conservation area. By detecting destruction early, stakeholders hope to curb deforestation proactively. Drones are also instrumental in tracking poachers and counting animal populations, supporting wildlife conservation efforts.

However, in recent times, an increasing number of Arizona farmers have turned to diminutive, remote-controlled aircraft, known as drones, to enhance yields while conserving water and reducing costs.\nKelly Thorp, an agricultural engineer at the U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, which falls under the Department of Agriculture, harnesses the power of drones to monitor the test fields. Thorp captures detailed images of cotton plants using these aerial devices, allowing for accurate assessment of soil quality and precise determination of crop water requirements.\nThorp enthusiastically states, \"Drones are an incredibly potent technology that provides regular field mapping, enabling informed decision-making processes. By ensuring higher accuracy in our choices, we become more efficient in the utilization of water resources.\"\nWhile irrigated agriculture has thrived in the Sonoran Desert for over a millennium, farming practices are profoundly influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Arizona is currently grappling with a two-decade-long drought, compounded by predictions from climatologists warning of rising temperatures and drier conditions in the Southwest.\nThe state witnessed a notable absence of the 2019 monsoon, serving as a cause for concern. Although some heavy rainfall arrived during late summer through sporadic storms, this was insufficient to counterbalance the persistently dry conditions, according to the Arizona Department of Water Resources. Consequently, long-term drought conditions have worsened, primarily affecting the northern two-thirds of the state.\nThis ongoing challenge places immense pressure on farmers. However, through utilizing drones to monitor water usage on their crops, farmers and agricultural engineers play a pivotal role in environmental preservation and water conservation \u2013 an increasingly critical concern considering water's status as the planet's most precious resource.\nPedro Andrade, assistant professor of agriculture at the University of Arizona, explains, \"Utilizing information for guiding input decisions makes drones an alternative to conventional farming. After conducting surveys of plants using drones, the collected data is analyzed and fed into a machine that calculates the optimal amount of water needed for each plot.\"\nDrones, whether multirotor or fixed-wing, provide invaluable insights into crop conditions, fertilizer requirements, yield potential, water quality monitoring, as well as early detection of leaks and pest infestations. These aircraft can be equipped with video and still-image cameras, thermal sensors for surface temperature analysis, and LIDAR technology for generating comprehensive 3-D field maps.\nThorp further elucidates, \"Thus, at the culmination of this process, I obtain a precisely segmented field map indicating varying water application levels across different areas. I firmly believe that drones hold tremendous promise for enhancing the efficiency of our agricultural decision-making processes and resource allocation.\"\nFarming is an inherently risky and expensive endeavor, and many farmers express trepidation regarding embracing this new technology. Paul Brierley, executive director of the Yuma Center of Excellence for Desert Agriculture, sheds light on this sentiment by stating, \"Farmers need convincing evidence that investing an additional $20 per acre for drone-based data collection will actually lead to improved productivity, larger yields, enhanced safety, or other desired outcomes.\"\nVarious companies are offering drone-based farming services, with the technology rapidly evolving in response to market demands. \"I believe we are currently witnessing a phase where companies are endeavoring to prove themselves,\" remarks Brierley. \"Different service providers are conducting trials as they strive to deliver innovative solutions in this domain.\"\nOver the past year, Kelly Thorp and his team have rigorously tested this technology on cotton plants, and they now aim to expand their research to encompass other crops.

The combustion of low-quality fuel by these vessels leads to the release of harmful pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides, as well as particulate matter. These emissions pose significant risks to respiratory and circulatory health. To tackle this issue, California implemented the Sulfur Rule in 2014, mandating ships to use cleaner fuel within 200 nautical miles of the coast. However, enforcing this regulation remains challenging due to limited manpower and time-consuming inspections.\n\nFortunately, a recent report conducted by UCLA environmental science students proposes a potential solution: employing advanced sensors mounted on industrial-scale drones. These drones can be deployed into a ship's exhaust plume to detect whether the burned fuel complies with legal limits. The UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability senior practicum facilitated this project, allowing students to apply their skills to real-world environmental problems.\n\nCollaborating with the ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused tech company, the student team investigated the impact of drone-assisted enforcement of the California Sulfur Rule on public health. They simulated two scenarios: one where ships violated the regulation at a rate similar to that observed in European waters (10%) and another assuming full compliance. ADEPT estimates that around 20 to 25 percent of ships currently violate the standards.\n\nBy integrating aerial monitoring and enhanced enforcement, it is projected that 55 deaths from air pollution could be prevented annually in communities near the ports of Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro. Furthermore, this approach would result in approximately $600 million in medical cost savings. The initial findings suggest that better enforcement could avoid 2,600 cases of asthma and 1,200 cases of acute asthma attacks requiring emergency room visits or hospitalization each year.\n\nRyan Hallman, lead author of the research and a recent UCLA graduate, emphasized that burning higher-sulfur fuel near coastal areas significantly increases particulate matter levels in the air, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities residing closest to commercial ports.\n\nThe study also revealed an erroneous assumption made by air quality modelers working for districts overseeing oceangoing vessels. These professionals had been assuming full compliance with the California Rule among ship operators, which led to an underestimation of the actual air pollution endured by disadvantaged port communities. This misconception hinders the implementation of effective countermeasures.\n\nTo demonstrate the drone-mounted sensor system, a six-propeller drone operated by Flying Lion, Inc. flew into the exhaust plume of the T. S. Golden Bear, a training ship operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. This demonstration occurred at the Port of L.A. on May 7, World Asthma Day, and attracted the attention of Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Approval for access to the Golden Bear involved a lengthy process, requiring authorization from various high-ranking officials responsible for both port security and the ship. However, the plume-sniffing operation itself took less than 10 minutes from take-off to landing and provided accurate results indicating that the ship was complying with the regulatory fuel requirements.\n\nIn addition to their public health research, the UCLA students presented the technology to stakeholders such as the Port of Long Beach and multiple air quality agencies. Following a meeting in San Francisco, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District committed $275,000 to co-fund a demonstration project aiming to adapt the technology to California's specific legal, geographical, security, and safety needs.\n\nAccording to Alex Spataru, CEO of the Adept Group, Inc., countries with significant port activity, including Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands, have already invested in drone enforcement, proving its cost-effectiveness. Denmark, for instance, has witnessed a 50% decrease in sulfur air pollution since implementing aerial monitoring of ocean-going vessels five years ago.\n\nFuture research teams at UCLA will delve deeper into sensor technology, particulate matter pollution, and the impacts on public health. If successful, similar strategies could be expanded along the entire west coast of the United States, safeguarding coastal communities.\n\n"

Aid workers and environmentalists are harnessing the power of drones to tackle various challenges and promote sustainable practices.\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations, the use of drones for military, commercial, and civil purposes has increased significantly over the years. From 41 countries in 2004, the count rose to 76 countries by 2011. Drones, equipped with cutting-edge technology, are no longer just tools of warfare but have evolved into versatile devices that can aid in fighting pollution, addressing social issues, and promoting sustainable development. Moreover, owning a drone is now affordable, with prices as low as $300.\n\nAs drone technology continues to progress rapidly, it is essential to understand its diverse technological and social impacts. Drones have bridged the gap between satellite imaging and ground surveying, providing remote access to areas that were previously difficult to reach. Activists, scientists, and aid workers can now compile reports, analyze situations, and gather data about regions, disasters, or specific issues efficiently, objectively, and securely. Beyond monitoring, drones can proactively contribute to delivering medical supplies, planting trees, and monitoring deforestation.\n\nDefining Drones\nOriginally developed for military purposes, drones were designed to carry out airstrikes, eliminating risks to aircraft operators. However, a new definition is required to encompass their broader applications in civilian contexts. Michael Perry, manager of drone production company DJI, suggests that drones should be defined as devices capable of flying, hovering, or navigating without pilot input. This definition distinguishes autonomous drones from those fully controlled by users. Drones available in the market come in various forms like quadcopters (four-propeller helicopters) or fixed-wing models that resemble small planes. For the purpose of this article, drones are defined as unmanned aerial vehicles deployed for humanitarian and environmental development projects.\n\nHow Do Drones Work?\nWhile drones may seem complex, understanding their basic functioning doesn't require Tesla-like genius. In a TED talk by Vijay Kumar, an expert from the University of Pennsylvania, he explains the working principle of quadcopter drones. These devices hover using four propellers rotating at the same speed. Adjusting the propeller speed controls the altitude, with faster rotations increasing height and slower rotations decreasing it. Horizontal movements occur through differential speeds among the propellers.\n\nDrones rely on multiple communication methods to interact with controllers, depending on their size and version. Radio waves and Wi-Fi are common means of control. Advanced drones come with built-in features like GPS chips, sensors, infrared systems, measuring tools, and cameras, enabling them to capture high-resolution images and even create 3D models.\n\nSurveillance and Mapping: Eyes in the Sky\nOne of the primary applications of drone technology is surveillance and monitoring. With their flexibility, ability to fly under cloud cover, and high-resolution cameras, drones offer advantages in wildlife conservation, environmental protection, and combating deforestation.

Quadcopters with live broadcasting capabilities can quickly reach breaking news spots or locations too hazardous for journalists. This democratization of journalism, referred to as \"sousveillance,\" empowers citizen reporters to contribute from anywhere. A notable example is the Occucopter, which livestreamed footage during the Occupy Wall Street protests when press access was restricted by authorities.\n\nLand Management and Wildlife Conservation\nOrganizations like Drone Adventures are using drones to map development areas and monitor landscapes. In Namibia, drones are employed to assess savanna regions, helping improve land management and conservation efforts. Drones also combat illegal logging and monitor endangered species by tracking poachers and counting animal populations. Projects like the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge encourage innovative solutions to address wildlife crime.\n\nDisaster Relief\nDrones are invaluable in disaster response, where access to affected areas can be challenging. They aid in searching for survivors and identifying risks like unexploded landmines. European Union projects used drones to locate survivors and displaced landmines following floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Drones provided detailed maps and photos, assisting relief efforts. Post-disaster, drones capture images and collect data for planning reconstruction and aid distribution.\n\nCargo Transportation: Flying from A to B\nCommercial services like Amazon are already exploring drones for package delivery, and tests for mail delivery are underway in Switzerland. In developing countries with poor road infrastructure, cargo drones offer fast and cost-effective options for transporting vital supplies. For example, Doctors Without Borders collaborated with Matternet to transport tuberculosis diagnosis samples in Papua New Guinea during the rainy season when roads were inaccessible. Cargo drones can act as a solution to infrastructure challenges faced in many regions in Africa.\n\nDrones as Tools: Active on the Ground\nBeyond observation and transportation, drones have utility as active tools to augment human work. Precision agriculture utilizes drones for geospatial analysis, allowing farmers to target specific areas with fertilizers or water, resulting in better resource management and reduced environmental impact. Startups like BioCarbon Engineering employ drones to reforest areas affected by illegal logging or deforestation, precisely planting seeds to restore ecosystems. Drones also support disaster response, acting as first responders to find trapped individuals and communicate with rescue teams. Medical drones, like the ambulance drone, enable rapid transport of emergency supplies and enhance efficiency in critical situations.\n\nThe Flipside: Sustainability, Regulation, and Privacy\nConsidering the potential of drone technology, it is important to assess its environmental impact. Factors such as materials used in production, sustainability, and end-of-life disposition should be considered to minimize e-waste. While personal quadcopters operate on battery power, eco-friendly alternatives are being explored, such as Google's Titan Solara-50, a solar-powered drone. However, challenges remain in achieving reliable operation using renewable energy sources.\n\nRegulation is another crucial aspect of drone technology. The United Nations emphasizes the need for transparency, ethical agreements, and responsible usage of drones in development aid. Concerns about privacy, safety, and data management require global regulations governing manufacturing, export, and licensing. Debates surrounding the responsible use of drones, especially in conflict zones, necessitate discussions among international authorities. Volunteer networks like UAViators aim to establish codes of conduct for drone usage in humanitarian situations.\n\nThe Future Outlook\nDrone technology showcases immense possibilities in humanitarian aid and environmental protection.

In this frontier of precision agriculture, Kelly Thorp, an agricultural engineer at the U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, employs drones to meticulously survey the center's test fields. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, these airborne wonders capture intricate images of cotton plants, providing invaluable insights into soil conditions and determining optimal irrigation needs.\n\nThorp believes that drones are wielding their power to revolutionize farming practices by steadily amassing field data, empowering decision-makers with precise information needed for resource allocation. \"Regularly mapping fields using drones offers tremendous potential in facilitating informed decision-making processes,\" Thorp asserts. By improving the accuracy of decisions related to crop management, farmers can significantly enhance water utilization efficiency.\n\nWhile irrigated agriculture has persisted for over a millennium in the Sonoran Desert, it is constantly challenged by seasonal weather patterns. The arid climate and a prolonged two-decade drought necessitate innovative solutions as climatologists forecast hotter and drier conditions for the Southwest. As the 2019 monsoon season fizzled out across most of Arizona, subsequent dry conditions perpetuated the state's long-term drought challenges, especially in its northern regions. Consequently, farmers face an ongoing battle to sustain agriculture in a parched environment. However, with drones monitoring water usage diligently, farmers and agricultural engineers now contribute positively to environmental conservation while safeguarding the planet's most precious resource\u2014water.\n\nPedro Andrade, an assistant professor of agriculture at the University of Arizona, advocates for the adoption of drone-powered agricultural practices.

      "text": "Drone Surveillance of Ship Emissions Could Safeguard Lives and Preserve Well-being\n\nArticle:\nMaritime transportation facilitates the delivery of goods people desire and require to our ports. Nonetheless, this mode of transport contributes to air pollution levels.\nWhen cargo ships burn low-cost, viscous fuel, their emissions encompass perilously high quantities of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants, combined with particulate matter, form a hazardous mixture that detrimentally affects respiratory and circulatory health.\nIn 2014, regulators in California introduced the Sulfur Rule, a mandate obligating ships to utilize cleaner fuel within 200 nautical miles of the coastline. However, implementation remains a formidable task. Presently, a few officers from the California Air Resources Board randomly examine ships' fuel at docks, an endeavor that consumes much time and resources and allows only two vessels to undergo inspection per day. Meanwhile, it is projected that over 6,600 cargo ships will dock annually along the California coast from 2021\u20132032. Given that the utilization of illicit, inexpensive fuel can save considerable sums of money per voyage, there exists a strong incentive to violate both state and federal laws.\nFortunately, a recent report drafted by environmental science students at UCLA suggests that technology might provide a solution. The report proposes the deployment of robust sensors affixed to industrial-scale drones capable of hovering within a ship's exhaust plume to determine if the burned fuel complies with legal limits.\nThis report constituted part of the senior practicum conducted at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. In this program, small teams of students partner with faculty advisors to tackle real-world problems on behalf of clients.\nNoah Garrison, the program director, highlighted the significance of this project, stating, \"The Practicum provides our students with an opportunity to assume leadership roles in addressing critical environmental issues at local and global levels. Simultaneously, they acquire expertise from scientists and policy experts across UCLA's comprehensive range of research programs.\"\nCollaborating with the ADEPT Group, Inc., an environmentally focused technology firm, the student team explored how drone-assisted enforcement of the California Sulfur Rule could impact public well-being. They devised models for two scenarios: one assumed a 10% cheating rate (similar to documented violations in European waters), while the other scenario presumed effective enforcement and full compliance. According to ADEPT, an estimated 20 to 25 percent of ships currently violate existing standards.\nBy enhancing enforcement through aerial monitoring, it is projected that 55 deaths resulting from air pollution could be prevented annually in communities such as Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach, and San Pedro. Moreover, this measure would result in approximately $600 million in savings on medical expenses. The initial findings suggest that improved enforcement would prevent around 2,600 asthma cases and 1,200 instances of asthma morbidity requiring emergency room visits or hospitalizations each year.\nRyan Hallman, a recent UCLA graduate and the lead author of the research, conveyed the repercussions of ships burning high-sulfur fuel near the coast, stating, \"They are increasing the concentration of particulate matter in the air along coastal areas and in communities adjacent to commercial ports\u2014often communities already burdened by disadvantages.\"\nAnother crucial revelation from the study was that air quality modelers working for air quality districts that deal with oceangoing vessels mistakenly assumed that ship operators were fully compliant with the California Rule. This false assumption implies that actual air pollution endured by disadvantaged communities near ports is underestimated, preventing effective countermeasures from being employed.\nAdditionally, the research uncovered that the financial motivators for ship operators to cheat far outweigh the current penalties imposed on violators in the rare instances when they are caught. Fines in court have ranged from only $7,500 to $10,000 per day spent in port.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, a drone-mounted sensor system was showcased at the Port of L.A. on May 7, World Asthma Day, in the presence of an audience including Mary Nichols, the chair of the California Air Resources Board. The six-propeller drone, operated by Flying Lion, Inc., soared into the exhaust plume of the T.S. Golden Bear, a training ship managed by the California State University Maritime Academy.\nNichols expressed the necessity of enforcing anti-pollution regulations at sea, stating, \"While enforcement of anti-pollution laws at sea is challenging, it is absolutely crucial in safeguarding the health of individuals residing in coastal communities. Whenever we encounter technology with potential to identify violations and hold vessel owners accountable, we want to test it.\"\nApproval to access the Golden Bear necessitated consent from numerous high-ranking officials, ranging from port security to ship personnel. Although this process took months, the entire plume-detection procedure lasted less than 10 minutes from take-off to landing. Most significantly, the results obtained accurately confirmed that the ship adhered to the regulatory limits by burning \"clean\" fuel.\nApart from the research on public health implications, the students presented the technology to various stakeholders, including the Port of Long Beach and multiple air quality agencies. During one meeting held in San Francisco, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District committed $275,000 to jointly fund a pilot project aimed at assessing how these technologies can be adapted to meet California's legal, geographical, security, and safety requirements.\nAccording to Alex Spataru, the CEO of the Adept Group, Inc., drone enforcement has already proven cost-effective in countries with bustling ports like Norway, Singapore, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Since implementing aerial monitoring of ocean-going vessels five years ago, Denmark has witnessed a 50% reduction in sulfur air pollution.\nFuture research teams at UCLA will delve further into sensor technology, the impact of particulate matter pollution, and its consequences on public health. If things progress favorably, similar methods could be expanded to protect coastal communities along the entire West Coast of the United States.\nSpataru emphasized the potential of employing proven technologies to eliminate violations cost-effectively, leading to positive public health outcomes across California, especially in vulnerable communities.\nTop Image: A sturdy drone equipped with sulfur sensors for testing ship emissions. | Nicki Aviel/UCLA"

In Nashville, the home of local entrepreneur Mark Cleveland's app called Hytch, commuters can earn up to 12 cents per mile carpooling through partnerships with area businesses. This includes major companies like Nissan, which offers a carpooling incentive of 5 cents per mile, as well as H.G. Hill Realty, Onin Staffing, Franklin Synergy Bank, and Lipscomb University. These incentives aim to encourage transportation alternatives and support Nashville's ongoing discussions about a $5.4 billion transit plan.\n\nAccording to Miranda Clements, who leads Nashville's new Transportation Demand Management program, more than 30 area businesses already cover the cost of public transit for their employees or provide reduced fares. Last year alone, over 1.1 million passengers utilized employer-backed fares for MTA services. To further promote alternative transportation methods, businesses are being encouraged to take advantage of the Internal Revenue Service's pre-tax income option, allowing employees to exclude up to $260 per month from their taxable income. Additionally, rather than subsidizing employee parking, businesses could subsidize public transportation or carpooling expenses, as well as provide secure bicycle parking and shower facilities to encourage bike commuting.\n\nCities like Washington D.C. and Seattle have already seen success with transit incentives. In D.C., the pre-tax transit benefit has proven to be the most effective transportation benefit for employers to offer. In Seattle, 60 percent of Metro transit riders have their fares paid for by their employers, both reducing costs and serving as a recruitment tool. Employers in New York also recognize the need for attractive mass transit incentives to motivate employees to choose public transport over driving.\n\nThe educational sector is also jumping on board with car-sharing initiatives, such as Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The university allows employees and students to ride public transit for free, resulting in significant usage numbers. In 2017, nearly 180,000 employees and over 42,000 students took advantage of free public transit. Vanderbilt University Medical Center also provides discounted carpool parking. Eric Kopstain, Vanderbilt's Vice Chancellor for Administration, emphasizes the importance of adopting alternative transportation to reduce pollution, ease congestion, and create a sustainable campus.\n\nHytch, the local app promoting carpooling, has already achieved impressive results since its launch. Over 850,000 shared miles have been tallied, with more than 65,000 carpooled trips and over 1 million vehicle miles not driven. The platform has facilitated rides for two passengers in most cases, but there have also been over 1,500 rides with seven or more passengers. Commuters using Hytch have earned a total of more than $31,000 through the incentives model since its introduction in February.\n\nCompanies like Onin Staffing are embracing carpool incentives to boost retention rates and make commuting more appealing in today's competitive job market. Automaker Nissan has also partnered with Hytch, as it aligns with the company's focus on intelligent mobility solutions that benefit the community.\n\nBeyond financial benefits, carpooling has additional advantages, including companionship and the ability to socialize during the commute. Jansen Donsbach, a legislative assistant in Nashville, shares a daily carpool with her sister-in-law, appreciating the opportunity to engage in conversations that help the time pass quickly.\n\nThese encouraging trends in the adoption of car-sharing and transit incentives highlight how businesses can contribute to reducing traffic congestion, attracting talented individuals, and promoting a sustainable future. As cities continue to improve their transportation infrastructure, the implementation of these initiatives plays a crucial role in shaping the overall effectiveness of transit systems and fostering environmentally responsible communities.\n\nReach out to Jamie McGee at 615-259-8071 and follow her on Twitter @JamieMcGee_."

      "text": "Title:\nThe Environmental Advantages of Car-sharing for a Sustainable Future\n\nArticle:\nIn the face of escalating concerns about climate change and its repercussions for humanity, individuals are taking proactive steps to protect the environment. One such initiative gaining popularity is car sharing. Rather than embarking on solo commutes, an increasing number of people are joining forces to commute together. Some organize car-sharing arrangements independently, while others opt for established car share services that connect like-minded individuals.\n\nHowever, the question arises \u2013 what exactly are the environmental benefits of car sharing? This guide aims to shed light on how car sharing positively impacts our world and why it is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nOne prominent environmental advantage of car sharing is its contribution to reducing emissions. With more people sharing rides, there is a significant decrease in the number of vehicles on the road, resulting in lower emissions. Minimizing emissions plays a pivotal role in environmental conservation as they are major contributors to climate change. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, car emissions account for 75% of carbon monoxide emissions in the country.\n\nIt is no secret that oil and gasoline have adverse effects on the environment. Their extraction can inflict severe damage to pristine natural landscapes, which is why regions like Antarctica are safeguarded from drilling activities. Additionally, reliance on these finite resources often leads to international conflicts. By engaging in car sharing, we reduce the number of cars on the road, consequently alleviating the demand for oil and gasoline. Preserving and conserving these resources becomes imperative considering their inevitable depletion and the positive impact it will have on future generations.\n\nFurthermore, shared cars used in car-sharing initiatives tend to be newer and more environmentally suitable. Research conducted by Intelligent Energy Europe reveals that shared cars are generally smaller and newer compared to those owned by average households. The ecological importance of newer cars cannot be overstated when considering the environmental benefits of car sharing. Newer models comply with up-to-date regulations, possess greater fuel efficiency, and incorporate advanced technology designed to minimize environmental harm.\n\nArguably one of the most intriguing aspects of car sharing is the flexibility of choices available to customers or organizers. When utilizing a car share service, individuals can select a vehicle that best suits their needs for a particular trip. For instance, a small shopping excursion necessitates a compact car. By tailoring transportation requirements to specific circumstances, car sharers optimize the use of resources. Ultimately, this approach reduces strain on the environment by ensuring that only necessary vehicles are utilized, avoiding excess and waste.\n\nIt is worth noting that car sharing does not imply the eradication of parking infrastructure and road expansion entirely. However, a major environmental benefit of car sharing is the decreased reliance on extensive parking facilities and road expansions. As the number of cars on the road diminishes, so does the demand for expanding existing roads, which often result in the degradation of scenic beauty spots. Additionally, constructing new infrastructure contributes to harmful emissions. Therefore, the less dependency on such developments, the greater the positive impact on the environment.\n\nEmbarking on your car-sharing journey promises a greener future. Embrace sustainable practices and take part in the growing movement toward responsible transportation. Together, we can create an environmentally conscious society while enjoying the convenience of car sharing.\n\nWriting and traveling are two passions that define me individually, and combining them creates my personal paradise. Alongside classic novels, I am also fervently dedicated to political involvement. Join me on Twitter and Instagram: @lxurenwhite"

      "text": "Car-pooling versus Car-sharing: The Solution for Greener and Cheaper Transportation\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, the average CO2 emissions of registered cars in Spain decreased by 4.5% compared to the same period in 2012*. However, transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide, with billions of vehicles on the roads. Although the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicles is on the rise\u2014an encouraging trend\u2014urban areas continue to suffer from severe pollution issues, leading to respiratory problems, the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and ozone layer depletion.\n\nWhile buying energy-efficient cars and adopting power-saving practices can reduce CO2 emissions, it's clear that more needs to be done. That's where new transportation trends come in, serving as crucial allies in emission reduction efforts while also saving money. Let us explain how:\n\nCut Costs and Emissions through Car Pooling! By sharing your car with others, you can offset your vehicle expenses, and passengers can save significantly on transportation costs while making an eco-friendly choice. Did you know that 63% of cars on the road carry only one driver? This contributes to traffic congestion and pollution. Sharing available seats in your vehicle is a simple yet effective way to address this issue and enjoy savings in the process.\n\nVarious companies utilize online platforms to connect millions of users interested in car pooling. How does it work? It's straightforward: if you have vacant seats in your car, you offer them, and if you need a ride, you find available seats. By connecting with other users, drivers, and passengers, you can conveniently travel together in a shared vehicle!\n\nAn alternative approach to reducing pollution and saving money is through Car Sharing services. This innovative practice goes beyond private cars and traditional rental services. With Car Sharing, you can rent a car by the hour at a much lower cost, which typically includes fuel expenses.\n\nThe company managing the Car Sharing service will provide you with an activated card. Using your mobile phone, you can easily locate nearby garages and check the availability of cars. Specify the duration you require, open the car using the provided card, and use it according to your needs. When you're done, return the car to the designated garage, and the time you utilized will be charged to your card. Just imagine the savings potential over a year! If you only require a car occasionally\u2014for weekend getaways or special occasions\u2014you can save on expenses like insurance, maintenance, and parking. It's not only great for your wallet but also for your city.\n\nEmbrace the Advantages of Car Sharing. Adopting this system has the potential to save you an average of \u20ac4,000 per year while simultaneously reducing the number of cars on the streets.\n\nAccording to Amovens, car sharing can save drivers living 20 km away from their workplace up to \u20ac1,500 annually. Additionally, if just 5% of employees in a company of 1,000 were to share a car with two colleagues residing 20 km away from work, they could collectively save \u20ac75,000 and prevent 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. For long journeys, car sharing offers savings ranging from 50% to 80%. These numbers make a compelling case, don't they?\n\nIncorporating car-pooling and car-sharing practices into our daily lives is a smart move both economically and ecologically. By actively participating in these initiatives, we can contribute to a greener environment while enjoying the financial benefits they offer. Let's drive towards a sustainable future together!\n\n*Please note that the specific data mentioned in the original article may no longer be accurate, and it is advised to refer to current statistics for up-to-date information."

      "text": "Businesses are using transit and carpooling incentives as effective tools for recruitment and sustainability in the car-sharing industry. This is seen through initiatives such as Hytch, an app developed by Mark Cleveland, which allows businesses in Middle Tennessee to pay commuters up to 12 cents per mile when they carpool. Companies like Nissan, H.G. Hill Realty, Onin Staffing, Franklin Synergy Bank, and Lipscomb University contribute to these incentives, encouraging employees to carpool from certain areas of Middle Tennessee.\n\nThe implementation of carpooling incentives coincides with the ongoing discussion around Nashville's proposed $5.4 billion transit plan, which has garnered support from many local businesses. These incentives have the potential to shape the effectiveness of the city's overall transit system by influencing commuting patterns and increasing ridership on mass transit and peer-to-peer ride-sharing services. By offering financial rewards and benefits, businesses can incentivize employees to choose alternative transportation methods, thereby alleviating congestion and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nApart from carpooling, businesses in the car-sharing domain are also becoming more proactive in supporting alternative transportation options for their employees. Over 30 local businesses already cover the cost of public transit or offer reduced fares to employees. In addition, the Transportation Demand Management program led by Miranda Clements aims to encourage businesses to take advantage of the Internal Revenue Service's pre-tax income option, allowing employees to exclude up to $260 a month for commuting expenses.\n\nTo truly enhance sustainability and improve quality of life for employees, businesses should consider subsidizing public transportation or carpooling and promote bicycle use through secured parking and shower facilities. By reducing parking demand and adopting a more environmentally responsible approach, companies can benefit from cost savings, increased recruitment and retention of talent, and a healthier and more productive workforce.\n\nThese transit incentives are not unique to Nashville. Other metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., Seattle, and New York have implemented similar programs that provide benefits such as pre-tax transit allowances, reimbursement for ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, and employer-paid transit fares. By making alternative transportation options more attractive and convenient than driving alone, these initiatives aim to shift commuter behaviors towards more sustainable modes of travel.\n\nVanderbilt University sets an excellent example by providing free public transit for employees and students, resulting in significant usage growth each year. This strategy helps reduce pollution and congestion while creating a more connected, sustainable, and healthy campus environment. Similarly, Hytch has successfully facilitated over 850,000 shared miles and more than a million vehicle miles not driven through its incentives model. The app's impact extends beyond reducing traffic, improving commutes, and conserving energy\u2014it also fosters social connections between passengers.\n\nIn conclusion, businesses are leveraging transit and carpooling incentives as powerful tools for recruitment and sustainability in the car-sharing industry. These initiatives align with the growing interest in alternative transportation methods, benefiting both employees and the community at large. By encouraging carpooling, subsidizing public transportation, and prioritizing the needs of commuters, businesses can create a positive impact on traffic congestion, air quality, and employee well-being."

      "text": "Title: The Environmental Advantages of Car-sharing\n\nArticle:\nIn the face of the escalating threat of climate change to humanity, more and more individuals are taking proactive steps to protect the environment. Car-sharing has emerged as one effective way to address this challenge. Instead of driving alone to work, people are joining forces and commuting together. While some arrange these shared trips independently, others rely on car-share services that bring like-minded individuals together through well-organized structures.\n\nFor skeptics wondering about the true environmental benefits of car-sharing, we've put together a comprehensive guide to shed light on how this practice can positively impact our world\u2014and why you should seriously consider embracing it.\n\nOne of the most obvious environmental benefits of car-sharing is its contribution to lower emissions. Simply put, when more people share a car, there are fewer vehicles on the road, leading to reduced emissions. This decrease in emissions is vital for environmental conservation, as car emissions alone account for a staggering 75% of carbon monoxide emissions in the United States, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to recognize that oil and petrol are significant contributors to environmental pollution. Their extraction poses great harm to natural beauty spots, exemplified by Antarctica's protection from drilling activities. Additionally, reliance on these resources often sparks international conflicts. By reducing the number of cars on the road through car-sharing, we can alleviate the strain on oil and petrol resources. Since these resources are finite, conserving them now becomes imperative for a sustainable future.\n\nFurthermore, vehicles used for car-sharing are typically newer and more environmentally friendly. According to Intelligent Energy Europe, shared cars tend to be smaller and newer than the average household vehicle. The significance of newer cars lies in their compliance with regulations, improved fuel efficiency, and advanced technological features. Therefore, by opting for car-sharing, individuals contribute to a greener environment by utilizing vehicles that have a smaller ecological footprint.\n\nAnother intriguing aspect of car-sharing is the freedom of choice it offers to customers or organizers. When using a car-share service, individuals have the flexibility to select the most suitable vehicle for their specific needs. For instance, if you're embarking on a small shopping trip, there's no need for a large car. This adaptability aligns with the environmental benefits of car-sharing because users only utilize what is necessary, avoiding excess consumption.\n\nCar-sharing does not imply eradicating the need for buildings altogether; however, it significantly reduces the dependency on parking infrastructure and the expansion of roads, which in turn mitigates the erosion of natural beauty spots. Furthermore, constructing such infrastructures contributes to additional emissions. Therefore, the less demand for these facilities, the healthier the environment remains.\n\nEmbracing car-sharing is not only beneficial for the environment but also enables individuals to adopt a green lifestyle. With the adverse effects of climate change becoming increasingly apparent, car-sharing represents a practical and impactful step towards a sustainable future. So, go ahead and join the car-sharing movement\u2014play your part in safeguarding our planet.\n\nWishing you all the best with your car-sharing endeavors! Stay green.\n\nAbout the author:\nI have an unwavering passion for exploring the world through writing and traveling. I enjoy immersing myself in classic literature and staying informed about political developments. Follow my Twitter and Instagram accounts @lxurenwhite for more exciting content."

      "text": "'Revolutionizing Campus Commuting with Sustainable Transportation Solutions'\n\nThe sustainable transportation program, an initiative known as Sustainable Mobility, forms an integral part of the College's three-year plan to study student commuting patterns and provide eco-friendly transportation services. Spearheaded by Max Cunningham \u201913, who secured a grant from William & Mary\u2019s Committee on Sustainability, the project aimed to enhance the existing carpooling program and promote sustainable travel choices. A comprehensive survey conducted in 2009 revealed that while students expressed interest in carpooling, many continued to commute alone.\n\nCunningham worked collaboratively with his faculty advisor, John Swaddle, as well as Bill Horatio, Director of Parking Services, and Carolyn Davis, Director of Auxiliary Services, throughout the previous summer to conduct research and devise strategies to improve the carpooling program. Recognizing the University community's desire for effective communication channels among those interested in carpooling, they sought to address this issue and concurrently bridge the information gap related to public transportation.\n\nThe innovative solution is accessible through the Sustainable Transportation channel on MyWM, an internal website catering to faculty, staff, and students at William & Mary. This dedicated platform offers users valuable resources such as Google Transit, facilitating the visualization of local bus routes and safe biking paths. Moreover, it provides access to the newly established \"William & Mary Rideshare Service,\" a cutting-edge online tool developed in partnership with Parking Services and AlterNet Rides, a renowned company specializing in creating digital carpool organization systems. The rideshare service recommends potential carpool partners based on their commuting schedules and locations.\n\nProfessor Swaddle, whose expertise lies in environmental science and biology, highlighted that William & Mary had an underutilized car-sharing program for years. He emphasized the importance of involving staff and graduate students, individuals who stand to gain the most economically and pragmatically from ride-sharing. \"Our aim was essentially to reinvigorate the system, generate awareness about its advantages within the W&M community, and make it more user-friendly,\" he explained.\n\nAs part of the project, Cunningham designed web pages for the Parking Services website to provide comprehensive information about the carpooling program and the associated benefits. For instance, carpool members now have the opportunity to share a parking pass, thereby splitting the cost among two to three individuals, depending on the carpool size. Additionally, Parking Services has allocated 25 prime parking spaces across campus, available on a first-come, first-served basis exclusively for carpoolers. Swaddle noted that 24 carpool passes were promptly purchased in response.\n\n\"In essence, 'transportation' accounts for a significant portion of W&M's carbon footprint. Hence, all these initiatives will substantially contribute to reducing harmful emissions,\" Swaddle emphasized. \"We also strive for these efforts to align with personal savings and health benefits for our community. Many of our options embody win-win situations, fostering sustainability in environmental, economic, and health dimensions.\"\n\nCunningham expressed confidence in the program's success and attributed its progress thus far to the strong support from Parking Services and Auxiliary Services. \"Having these departments as a support system\u2014entities that truly foster idea development and transformation into reality\u2014is paramount,\" he acknowledged. \"Given the exceptional support system here, I firmly believe in the future of this project.\"\n\nAccording to Cunningham, William & Mary's journey towards establishing a sustainable student commuting system is merely beginning. \"We eagerly await the response to the carpooling program and the tools we offer to facilitate carpools.

By sharing a car with other passengers, individuals can collectively offset the vehicle costs while significantly reducing their transportation expenses. What's more, it's an eco-conscious choice. Surprisingly, approximately 63% of cars on the road carry only the driver, leading to increased congestion and pollution. The solution? Utilize available empty seats by participating in car pool programs to minimize traffic while enjoying financial savings.\n\nNumerous companies have harnessed the power of the internet to connect millions of like-minded individuals interested in carpooling. But how does this platform work? It's simple: drivers who have spare seats offer them to potential passengers, while passengers seeking shared rides connect with these drivers. They embark on journeys together, thus creating a collaborative and environmentally friendly mode of transportation.\n\nAnother effective approach to reducing pollution and saving money comes in the form of Car Sharing services. This innovative concept provides an alternative to private car ownership and traditional car rental services. With Car Sharing, individuals can rent a car by the hour while enjoying economical pricing that includes fuel costs.\n\nManaging the entire process, Car Sharing companies conveniently provide users with an activation card. By utilizing a dedicated mobile application, users can locate nearby garages and check the availability of cars. Once a suitable car is selected, they can access it using the provided card, ensuring a seamless experience. Users are charged based on the duration of their usage, and after completing their journey, they can easily return the car to the designated garage. Just imagine the potential yearly savings\u2014an opportunity to forgo annual expenses such as car insurance, maintenance, and parking fees. This option proves especially beneficial for occasional drivers, like those who reserve vehicles for weekend getaways or special occasions. Not only does it boost your personal finances but also contributes positively to the city's environment.\n\nEmbracing Car Sharing yields attractive advantages. It has the potential to save individuals an average of \u20ac4,000 per year, simultaneously decreasing the number of cars on the roads. According to Amovens, residents living 20 km away from their workplace could save about \u20ac1,500 annually through active participation in car sharing. Furthermore, considering a scenario where only 5% of employees in a 1,000-strong company opted to share a car with two colleagues residing in close proximity, astonishing savings of \u20ac75,000 and a remarkable reduction of 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions could be achieved every year. On long journeys, individuals sharing a car can experience savings ranging between 50% and 80%\u2014an excellent prospect to explore!\n\nIn conclusion, car sharing presents a compelling solution for eco-conscious commuters seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and optimize their expenses. By actively participating in car pooling initiatives and embracing Car Sharing services, individuals can make a significant positive impact on both their wallets and the environment.\n\n(*Note: Please ensure that the mentioned statistics are accurate and up-to-date at the time of rewriting the article.)"

      "text": "Title: The Evolution of Car Sharing Systems for Sustainable Urban Mobility\n\nIntroduction\nThe automotive industry has been actively striving to minimize the environmental impact caused by vehicles. A noteworthy initiative in this realm is BMW's \"DriveNow\" car sharing project, which offers convenient access to short-term rental cars throughout a city.\n\nCar Sharing System Overview\nIn this car sharing system, customers can register and locate available cars online or through a dedicated app. The vehicles can be parked anywhere within the designated operating area. However, if a customer wishes to return the car outside the service area, a relocation fee is applicable to offset the cost of returning it.\n\nThis particular car sharing service is a collaboration between two prominent German car manufacturers, Daimler AG and the BMW Group. Our focus will be on the implementation of the BMW Group's platform, known as \"DriveNow.\"\n\nApplying Sustainability Concepts to the Car Sharing System\n\nStep 1: Analysis of Key Values\nTo begin our sustainability analysis, we must identify the goals defined in our case study and align them with the generic values. This analytical process helps us develop an urban car sharing platform that adheres to sustainable principles. Referencing the table below, let's explore the outcomes of this step:\n\n[Table]\n\nStep 2: Identification of Activities, Indicators, and Regulations\nContinuing our sustainability analysis, we now delve into identifying activities, indicators, and regulations that influence the previously determined values. Taking an overview perspective of the model, we can identify patterns that emerge. For this purpose, we have used the case study as a reference point to identify relevant activities. It's important to note that some necessary details were missing from the case study, so indicators and regulations had to be defined based on the values. The following instantiation of the sustainability model illustrates the results:\n\n[Model Description]\n\nThe green elements in the model represent additional activities that were included in the sustainability analysis but not presented in the original case study. These activities contribute to the overall sustainability of the car sharing system.\n\nStep 3: Linking Activities to Indicators\nIn this step, we establish direct and indirect links between activities and indicators in the urban car sharing sustainability model. By understanding the influences between these elements, we can define implementation constraints in the requirements engineering content model. Direct influences offer more flexibility in implementation, while indirect influences are contingent on specific activity implementation. With the completion of this step, we have a comprehensive model that captures all the key indicators to monitor during the development process, guaranteeing adherence to sustainability principles.\n\nSystem Vision\n\"DriveNow,\" developed by BMW, embodies a smart system designed for flexible individual mobility and cost-efficient travel. By allowing drivers to replace their personal cars with a shared model, it contributes to modernizing the carpool concept while promoting emission reduction. DriveNow caters to both price-oriented customers seeking affordable mobility options and sporadic users who only require occasional access to a vehicle.\n\nUse Case Overview Diagram\n\nConclusion\nThe sustainability model for the urban car sharing platform identified additional important goals such as \"low maintenance susceptibility\" and \"vehicle independent integration.\" These goals enrich the requirements engineering content model by illustrating the composition of sustainability features. Identifying activity patterns reveals potential weaknesses that could jeopardize the system's sustainability if single activities are compromised (e.g., electric cars). Furthermore, establishing direct and indirect influences between activities and indicators enables a thorough assessment of the sustainability model through real-world examples.\n\nWhile obtaining sustainability data for real-world applications without monitoring indicators remains challenging, our case study, inspired by the \"DriveNow\" system from the BMW Group, provides valuable insights into achieving sustainable urban mobility through car sharing."

      "text": "Businesses Embrace Car-sharing and Mass Transit Incentives as Tools for Recruitment and Sustainability\n\nTo combat traffic congestion and encourage sustainable transportation options, businesses in Tennessee are taking innovative steps to incentivize carpooling and public transit use. One such initiative is Hytch, an app developed by local entrepreneur Mark Cleveland, that rewards Middle Tennessee commuters with up to 12 cents per mile for carpooling. Nissan, H.G. Hill Realty, Onin Staffing, Franklin Synergy Bank, and Lipscomb University are among the local businesses contributing to these incentives.\n\nThe growing popularity of transit incentives highlights the need for effective transportation solutions, particularly amid Nashville's ongoing debate over a $5.4 billion transit plan. Local companies recognize the potential impact of influencing commuting patterns on the overall success of the city's transit system. The implementation of incentives through cost-sharing models can significantly increase ridership and alleviate congestion on both mass transit and highways, according to Cleveland.\n\nBeyond carpooling incentives, over 30 companies in the area cover the cost of public transit for employees or provide reduced fares. Miranda Clements, who leads Nashville's Transportation Demand Management program, explains that businesses are increasingly taking advantage of the Internal Revenue Service's option to exclude up to $260 per month from an employee's income, resulting in pre-tax savings. Moreover, companies are encouraged to consider subsidizing public transportation, secure bicycle parking, and shower facilities instead of subsidizing parking, allowing them to reduce parking demand while promoting sustainable and eco-friendly practices.\n\nSimilar initiatives have been successful in other metropolitan areas. In the Washington, D.C., region, employers offer the pre-tax transit benefit as part of their comprehensive benefits package, alongside healthcare and retirement plans. Some Seattle employers pay a reduced rate to the city, covering the cost of Metro transit fares for their employees, using it as both a recruitment tool and a means to manage rising transit demands. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt University supports alternative transportation modes by offering free public transit for employees and students, resulting in increased usage of mass transit.\n\nAchieving a significant shift towards alternative transportation requires making it more attractive and convenient than driving alone. Factors such as reduced parking costs, service quality, and congestion influence commuter choices. While business-led incentives play a crucial role, the public sector's influence on traffic patterns through infrastructure enhancements and improved services remains critical.\n\nHugh Thomas, a managing partner at Onin Staffing firm, recognizes that adopting incentives like Hytch can boost retention in a competitive job environment and make commutes more appealing. Nissan has also partnered with Hytch to align their efforts with their global intelligent mobility initiative, which aims to integrate cars into society while benefiting the community.\n\nFor commuters like Jansen Donsbach, carpooling not only saves money but adds an unexpected bonus\u2014companionship during the commute. With the ability to socialize and engage with others rather than sitting in silent solitude, carpooling offers a more enjoyable and productive experience.\n\nAs the debate on sustainable transportation continues, businesses are leveraging car-sharing and transit incentives to attract talent, reduce carbon emissions, and contribute to building greener communities."

      "text": "Title:\nThe Environmental Advantages of Car-Sharing: A Sustainable Solution\n\nArticle:\nAmidst the ever-looming threat of climate change, individuals are taking proactive steps to protect the environment. One innovative solution gaining popularity is car-sharing, a practice that not only benefits individuals but also offers significant advantages for the planet. In this article, we will shed light on the environmental benefits of car-sharing and explain why it is worth considering.\n\nOne immediate and evident environmental advantage of car-sharing is the reduction in emissions. By sharing a vehicle, the number of cars on the road decreases, leading to lower overall emissions. This reduction is crucial because emissions play a pivotal role in exacerbating climate change. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, car emissions account for a staggering 75% of carbon monoxide emissions in the US alone.\n\nAdditionally, car-sharing contributes to a decreased reliance on oil and petrol, which are notorious pollutants. Extraction processes often harm natural landscapes, as seen by the protective measures taken to preserve Antarctica from drilling activities. Furthermore, conflicts sometimes arise due to the struggle for control over these limited resources. By embracing car-sharing, we can reduce the demand for oil and petrol, effectively curbing their negative environmental impact. As these resources are finite, conservation efforts become even more vital for a sustainable future.\n\nFurthermore, car-sharing typically involves the use of newer and more environmentally friendly vehicles. Research from Intelligent Energy Europe highlights that shared cars tend to be both smaller and newer compared to those owned by individual households. The significance of newer cars cannot be understated when considering the environmental benefits of car-sharing. Generally, newer vehicles align with updated regulations, ensuring greater fuel efficiency and improved technological advancements, resulting in reduced environmental footprints.\n\nCar-sharing also empowers participants with the freedom to choose the most suitable vehicle for their specific needs. Whether embarking on a quick shopping trip or planning a family outing, car-share services allow for tailored transportation solutions. This flexibility allows individuals to utilize vehicles optimally, minimizing unnecessary resource consumption. Ultimately, by only using what is necessary, less strain is placed on the environment, promoting sustainability.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that car-sharing does not imply the elimination of infrastructure. However, one notable environmental benefit of car-sharing is a decreased demand for parking facilities and road expansion. Fewer cars on the road lessen the necessity for extensive road network development, helping to preserve natural beauty spots. It is worth noting that constructing such infrastructure also generates its own emissions. Therefore, reducing our reliance on expanded road networks leads to a double win for the environment.\n\nEmbracing car-sharing offers a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional commuting practices. As individuals come together to share vehicles, the positive impact on the environment becomes apparent. From lowering emissions and diminishing reliance on oil and petrol to utilizing newer, greener vehicles and reducing the need for extensive infrastructure, car-sharing showcases itself as an essential component of a sustainable future.\n\nBest of luck in your car-sharing journeys! Let's stay committed to a greener world.\n\nAbout the author:\nI have an unwavering passion for writing and exploring new destinations. Combining the two brings me pure joy.

      "text": "Car Pooling or Car Sharing: Reducing Carbon Emissions and Saving Money\n\nThe demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles is growing steadily, contributing to a 4.5% decrease in average CO2 emissions of cars registered in Spain during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012*. However, transportation remains one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. With billions of vehicles on the roads worldwide, major cities continue to battle high pollution levels, leading to various health issues and environmental concerns such as asthma, emphysema, smog, acid rain, and ozone layer depletion.\n\nWhile purchasing energy-efficient cars and adopting power-saving habits can reduce individual CO2 emissions, it's vital to explore emerging transportation trends that can effectively combat emissions while also delivering financial savings. Let's dive into two innovative solutions:\n\n1. Car Pooling: A Sustainable Way to Share Journeys and Expenses\nImagine the positive impact if we could address the issue of single-occupancy vehicles comprising 63% of cars on the road. Car pooling offers a solution by allowing drivers and passengers to share rides and costs. By matching people with similar travel routes, this shared mobility approach optimizes vehicle occupancy, reducing traffic congestion and ultimately cutting pollution levels.\n\nVarious companies are leveraging internet platforms to connect millions of like-minded users interested in car pooling. The process is simple: drivers offer available seats in their cars, while passengers search for seats. Through these networks, users connect and embark on shared journeys, promoting sustainable transportation practices while saving money.\n\n2. Car Sharing: An Innovative Alternative to Traditional Car Rental\nCar sharing is an emerging trend revolutionizing personal mobility options. It provides an economic and eco-conscious alternative both to private car ownership and traditional car rental services. Unlike owning a car, which incurs high annual costs for insurance, maintenance, and parking, car sharing allows individuals to rent vehicles by the hour, with fuel costs included at a significantly lower price point.\n\nCompanies facilitating car sharing streamline the process through the utilization of cards and mobile applications. After activating a personalized card, users can easily locate nearby garages and available cars via their smartphones. Once a vehicle is selected, the user accesses the car using their card and pays only for the duration they need it. When finished, the car is returned to the designated garage, and charges are conveniently applied to the card. The potential savings from utilizing car sharing services throughout the year can be substantial, especially for occasional car users who primarily need transportation for weekend getaways or special occasions.\n\nThe Advantages of Embracing Car Pooling and Car Sharing\nImplementing car pooling and car sharing initiatives brings multiple advantages. Firstly, individuals can experience an average annual savings of \u20ac4,000 by participating in these sustainable mobility practices. Furthermore, these initiatives contribute to fewer cars on the streets, easing traffic congestion and reducing pollution levels.\n\nAccording to Amovens, car sharing has the potential to save drivers residing 20 km away from their workplace around \u20ac1,500 annually. Moreover, if just 5% of employees in a company of 1,000 adopted car sharing, sharing a car with two colleagues residing 20 km from work, the cumulative savings would amount to \u20ac75,000 and a remarkable reduction of 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. On longer journeys, car sharing can result in cost savings ranging between 50% and 80%. These statistics paint a compelling picture of the benefits associated with embracing shared mobility models.\n\nIn conclusion, as we strive for a greener future and sustainable transportation systems, car pooling and car sharing emerge as powerful allies. By actively engaging in these practices, we can collectively combat GHG emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, save money, and promote a healthier environment. So, why not ponder upon the immense value of adopting these innovative approaches to transportation?"

This article explores the implementation and effectiveness of a sustainability model specifically tailored to car-sharing.\n\nCar Sharing System Overview\nTo avail the cars, customers need to register online or at the company's physical location. Upon registration, they are provided with a unique ID and can locate available cars through the web or a dedicated app. The beauty of this system is that the cars can be parked anywhere within the designated operating area of the car-sharing service. However, if a customer parks the car outside the operating area and wishes to end their rental, they will incur a relocation fee to bring the vehicle back within the service's boundaries.\n\nDriveNow, the car-sharing service under scrutiny in this case study, is a joint effort between two renowned German automakers, Daimler AG and the BMW Group. We will specifically focus on the BMW Group's platform and analyze the sustainability aspects of their DriveNow service.\n\nApplying the Sustainability Concept to the Car-Sharing System\nStep 1: Analysis of Generic Values\nIn the initial stage of analysis, we extract the generic values relevant to our case study goals. The table below outlines the development process undertaken for the urban car-sharing platform.\n\nStep 2: Identification of Activities and Indicators\nMoving forward, we identify the activities, indicators, and regulations that affect the aforementioned generic values. Taking a holistic view of the model aids in recognizing emerging patterns. While the case study does not provide all the necessary information, it serves as a starting point for identifying activities. The subsequent instantiation of the sustainability model incorporates the missing pieces, including indicators and regulations.\n\nStep 3: Linking Activities to Indicators\nThis step reveals direct and indirect connections within the urban car-sharing sustainability model. By discerning these influences, we can establish implementation constraints and specify requirements for the content model of the car-sharing platform. Direct influences allow for more flexibility, while indirect influences depend on the successful implementation of certain activities. This modeling process helps us monitor the defined indicators throughout the development phase, ensuring the sustainability of the system.\n\nSystem Vision\nDriveNow, developed by BMW, envisions a smart system that revolutionizes individual mobility by offering cost-efficient and flexible travel options. The service contributes to the modernization of car usage patterns, encouraging drivers to replace their personal vehicles with more economical sharing models, thereby reducing emissions. Additionally, DriveNow caters to both price-oriented individuals seeking convenient mobility options and occasional car users.\n\nUse Case Overview Diagram\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, our sustainability model for the urban car-sharing platform unveils additional goals for the content model. For instance, \"low maintenance susceptibility\" and \"vehicle independent integration\" emerge as crucial goals. Analyzing activity patterns provides valuable insights into potential weaknesses that could undermine overall sustainability, such as reliance on single activities like electric cars. Finally, identifying the direct and indirect influences between activities and indicators enables us to assess and validate the sustainability model using real-world examples.\n\nIt is important to note that sustainability data from existing car-sharing applications, like DriveNow, can be challenging to obtain, especially when indicators specific to sustainability monitoring are not readily available. Nonetheless, these challenges underscore the necessity for vigilant monitoring and continuous improvement to ensure the long-term success of car-sharing initiatives in promoting sustainable urban mobility."
